<h5 id="undertakings"><strong>Undertakings</strong>:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Web development</strong>: A frankly inadvisible amount of website-wrangling throughout this week, including some late-night rabbit-holes and debugging loops. I’m now most of the way through an LLM-supported rebuild, shifting my site away from Wordpress to a Jekyll static site.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> With outside machine support, I’ve been getting more comfortable with working in the command line, Visual Studio Code, etc., and have successfully implemented wiki-style linking, tagging, and a backlinking system, and got a rudimentary vis.js knowledge graph up and running.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Latent Intimacies</strong> Check-in with <a href="https://vjnks.com/">Vytas</a> on Tuesday evening, synchronising our thinking about how to develop some of the outcomes of the “Synthetic Minds” collaborative prototyping residency we were part of back in January-February; also helped him think through some text for an (unrelated) publication later in the week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Choreographing attention</strong>: IM meeting with M (dialling in from a electric vehicle charging station somewhere in Croatia), postponed after I spread myself a bit too thinly last week; talked through plans for getting stuck into the next <a href="https://fo.am/activities/anarchive/">Anarchive</a> Reader, committing to a focused two-week editorial sprint from the 27th, as something preferable to a more thinly-spread, partial approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enxaneta</strong>: Week twoish of a planned six-month Python-for-ethnography collaborative skill exchange with <a href="https://www.timcowlishaw.co.uk/">Tim</a>; reflecting on some on my website-wrangling experiences, and the outcomes of a <a href="https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta/blob/main/documentation/ethnography/01_ethnographic-observation.md">field observation exercise</a> I’d set. We talked a bit about critical technical practice, Britishness abroad, Mariann Vaczi’s monograph <em>Catalonia’s Human Towers</em>, and different approaches to bounding and specifying ethnographic fieldsites, and set some next steps for the coming weeks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="side-missions"><strong>Side-missions</strong>:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dowsing</strong>: Caught an afternoon screening of <em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/la-chimera-review-digital-release">La Chimera</a></em> with D over the weekend, which was shaggy and weird, with a dreamy energy that seeped into the rest of the week. Now imagining a dowsing-specific double feature, running it alongside Ben Wheatley’s <em>A Field in England</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Thick presents</strong>: Social catch-up with <a href="https://www.richardsandford.net/about/">Richard</a>, having been in close contact during a flurry of activity putting together an (unsuccessful) funding proposal for a small project on ecological citizenship earlier in the year; we’re both going to be at <a href="https://anticipationconference.org/">Anticipation</a> in September, so useful to get a sense of the kinds of things he’s thinking about (<a href="https://www.richardsandford.net/2024/04/24/thick-present-in-trento/">※</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>On the jagged frontier</strong>: Monthly Friday morning call with <a href="https://andrewlb.com/">Andrew</a>, a little unfocused after staying up into the early hours wrestling with GitHub branches; a wide-ranging chat, covering Wardley maps of dog-breeding as a service, generative AI’s <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=64700">jagged frontier</a>, the <em>Tao of Pooh</em>, and the ‘protocolisation of small team collaboration’ (whatever that means).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="next-week"><strong>Next week</strong>:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Shift from technical web development to tweaking the site’s look and feel, and thinking about content strategy</li>
  <li>Another skill exchange session with Tim, going deeper on participant observation and fieldnotes</li>
  <li>Editing work, sketching some ‘serving suggestions’ for a deconstructed photo book</li>
  <li>Call about an archiving/experimental publishing side-mission</li>
</ul>
