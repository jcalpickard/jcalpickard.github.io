<p>Collaboration, knowledge sharing, and <a href="https://www.are.na/block/6898593">orienteering</a> were recurring motifs, while puzzling through new (technical and conceptual) terrain. A sense of growing momentum, even as I’m still figuring out how to balance focus and receptivity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Frankly absurd amount of webdev-wrangling throughout the week (including late nights), part-way through an LLM-supported rebuild, to shift my site away from Wordpress to a Jekyll static site deployed through GitHub Pages; late night rabbit-holes and debugging loops, driven to the brink of madness on more than one occasion; getting comfortable with working in the command line, Visual Studio Code, etc., and managed to implement wiki-style linking, tagging, and a backlinking system, and get an auto-populated rudimentary vis.js knowledge graph up and running.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Caught an afternoon screening of <em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/la-chimera-review-digital-release">La Chimera</a></em> with D over the weekend, which was shaggy and weird and kind of wonderful. Now imagining running it alongside Ben Wheatly’s <em>A Field in England</em> as a dowsing-specific double feature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check-in with <a href="https://vjnks.com/">Vytas</a>, working through some initial ideas and synchronising our thinking about how to develop some of the outcomes from this “Synthetic Minds” collaborative prototyping residency we were part of in Madrid back in Jan-Feb; also helped him think through some text for an (unrelated) application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social catch-up with <a href="https://www.richardsandford.net/about/">Richard</a>, talking posterity, gaps, and computational thinking, after a flurry of activity with him and some others earlier in the year putting together an (unsuccessful) funding proposal for a small project on ecological citizenship and the Settlement House Movement; we’re both going to be at <a href="https://anticipationconference.org/">Anticipation</a> in September, so useful to get a sense of where his head’s currently at</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IM meeting with M (dialling in from a electric vehicle charging station somewhere in Croatia), postponed after I spread myself a bit too thinly last week; talked through plans for getting stuck into the next <a href="https://fo.am/activities/anarchive/">Anarchive</a> Reader, committing to a more focused two-week writing-and-editing sprint from the 27th over a more thinly-spread, partial attention</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Week twoish of a planned six-month (?) translocal Python-for-ethnography collaborative skill exchange with <a href="https://www.timcowlishaw.co.uk/">Tim C.</a>; reflecting on some on my website-wrangling experiences, and the outcomes of a <a href="https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta/blob/main/documentation/ethnography/01_ethnographic-observation.md">field observation exercise</a> I’d set Tim; talked a bit about critical technical practice, ‘Tiny Weird Software’, Mariann Vaczi’s monograph <em>Catalonia’s Human Towers</em>, and different approaches to bounding and specifying ethnographic fieldsites, while some next steps for the coming weeks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soon-to-be-recurring Friday morning call with <a href="https://andrewlb.com/">Andrew</a>,   a little unfocused after staying up into the early hours wrestling with GitHub branches; wide-ranging chat, covering Wardley maps of dog-breeding, generative AI’s <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=64700">jagged frontier</a>, the <em>Tao of Pooh</em>, and the ‘protocolisation of small team collaboration’ (whatever that means).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Next week: Shift from technical web development to tweaking the site’s look and feel and thinking about content strategy. Another skill exchange session with Tim, going deeper on participant observation and fieldnotes. Couple of lumps of editing, sketching some “serving suggestions” for a deconstructed photo book. Call about an archiving/experimental publishing side-mission.</p>
