<p>Operating from a home base in the haunted, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/25/bringing-my-family-back-to-the-uk-was-a-bad-decision-but-home-has-its-comforts">flood-prone</a> city of York, I use ethnographic methods to uncover hidden meanings and challenge dominant narratives. In my work life, I’ve sought out opportunities to pursue open-ended, exploratory research in different settings. I have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>co-founded a research company</li>
  <li>taught observational methods</li>
  <li>facilitated workshops</li>
  <li>participated in a collaborative prototyping residency on human-AI intimacies</li>
  <li>conducted fieldwork on the <a href="/phd/">cultural politics of infrastructure in Gujarat</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These experiences (and others) instilled a deep appreciation for creative, cross-disciplinary inquiry. Today, I am at my happiest working with others to decipher complex or uncertain situations.</p>

<p>Key research interests include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>appropriate technology</li>
  <li>communities of practice</li>
  <li>translocal processes</li>
  <li>knowledge bases, repositories, and information retrieval</li>
  <li>improvisation and contingency in the design and use of technology</li>
</ul>

<p>Having recently tumbled into the gravity well of generative language models, I am also now trying to learn Python.</p>
