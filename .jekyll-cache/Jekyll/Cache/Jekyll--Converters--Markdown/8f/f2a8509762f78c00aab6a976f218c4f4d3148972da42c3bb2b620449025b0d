<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ğŸ“§ The best way to contact me is over <a href="mailto:jcalpickard@proton.me">email</a>. After two decades on Gmail, Iâ€™ve recently switched the bulk of my personal communications to Proton Mail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ğŸŒ I have a <a href="https://assemblag.es/@jcalpickard">profile</a> on <a href="https://assemblag.es/">Assemblag.es</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown/wiki">Mastodon fork</a> administered by off-duty science and technology studies researchers.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Decentralised by design, the platformâ€™s granular privacy settings and self-deleting archive have been instrumental in weaning me off Twitter, while presenting fresh opportunities to post into the void.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ğŸ“· I share photos of strange objects, sights, and situations with friends and trusted others on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jcalpickard/">Instagram</a>. Having somehow dazzle-camouflaged Metaâ€™s ad-targeting systems, I also treat the platform as a window into the collective unconscious; a way of monitoring the ebb and flow of dropshippers and get-rich-quick schemes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>âŒ¨ï¸ To streamline my website management, Iâ€™ve recently moved from Wordpress to a static site using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Iâ€™m hoping this new setup will short-circuit some of the friction of posting, helping me push more regular updates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ğŸ‘” Iâ€™m on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinpickard/">LinkedIn</a>, though I donâ€™t pretend to understand it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ğŸ—‚ï¸ Iâ€™m an enthusiastic user of research and collaboration platform <a href="https://www.are.na/justin-pickard/index">Are.na</a>, which keeps me attuned to the weird art kids 15 years my junior.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Iâ€™ve been using the site since March 2020, and over the years, itâ€™s become a kind of (searchable) prosthetic memory, and a key part of how I use the internet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>â˜• In-person conversation has its own magic, and Iâ€™m always game for a coffee or a walk. So if youâ€™re passing through York, Leeds, or elsewhere in the north of England, let me know, and weâ€™ll line something up.</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m currently participating in an improbable Python-for-ethnography skill exchange with <a href="https://www.timcowlishaw.co.uk/">Tim</a>, our server admin. Wouldnâ€™t have got that on Twitter.Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">â¤´ï¸</a></p>

      <p>After buying an Are.na-branded hoodie to justify the cost of shipping the platformâ€™s print annual from the US, the <a href="https://store.are.na/products/unisex-hoodie">offending garment</a> has ended up in regular circulation, earning impressed and/or bewildered reactions from those in-the-know.Â <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">â¤´ï¸</a></p>
