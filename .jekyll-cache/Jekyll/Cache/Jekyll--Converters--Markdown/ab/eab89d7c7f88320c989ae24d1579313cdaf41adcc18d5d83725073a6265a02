I"î<p>A hands-on, experimental approach to problem-solving and innovation, through incremental adjustments to what already exists. Playful exploration. A willingness to engage with materials or mechanisms directly. Repair, repurposing, a cyclical process of trial and error, through experiments and iteration.</p>

<p>Tinkering values discovery, embracing failure as opportunities to learn and refine ideas. Tinkerers work with a variety of tools and materials, drawing inspiration from diverse fields and integrating different skillsets. Tactile exploration?</p>

<ul>
  <li>What does tinkering tell us about the balance between dogged persistence and knowing when to pivot or abandon a given approach?</li>
  <li>Where are there tensions/trade-offs between efficiency and open-ended exploration?</li>
  <li>How does the physicality/materiality of tinkering contribute to the problem-solving process?</li>
  <li>How do sequences of smaller adjustments contribute to the evolution of ideas? Does incrementalism come with drawbacks?</li>
  <li>Is tinkering a solo practice, or can it involve collective/collaborative problem-solving?</li>
  <li>Is successful tinkering determined by the end result, or does the process have intrinsic value? How do people reflect on and evaluate their tinkering experiences?</li>
  <li>How do professionals incorporate tinkering into fields such as engineering, design, or research?</li>
  <li>How how are tinkering practices transmitted and reproduced?</li>
  <li>How does the informal nature of tinkering contribute to or hinder its ability to create lasting change?</li>
  <li>How does technological development impact tinkering practices? Does technology create new possibilities for tinkering, or does it introduce new barriers?</li>
</ul>
