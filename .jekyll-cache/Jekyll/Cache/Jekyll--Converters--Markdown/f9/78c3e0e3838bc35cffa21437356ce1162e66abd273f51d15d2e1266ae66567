<p>Drawing on ten months of field-based research in the city of Ahmedabad, the thesis reveals the social and political lives of infrastructural systems. Ahmedabadâ€™s urban landscape provided a revelatory setting to examine issues of appropriateness and equity â€“ from the adaptive reuse of traditional water systems in the old cityâ€™s <em>pols</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, to the import of foreign â€˜smart cityâ€™ best practices, and competing visions for developing the Sabarmati riverfront.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Conceptually, the thesis contributes to ideas of â€˜appropriate infrastructureâ€™<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and â€˜sociotechnical flÃ¢nerieâ€™<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, while spotlighting three key dynamics shaping infrastructure projects: mutability (a given systemâ€™s flexibility or capacity for adaptation), mobility (the transfer of technologies, plans, and best practices between locations), and worlding (how competing visions are enacted through infrastructure). Grasping these is, I argue, a crucial step in realising more just and inclusive urban futures.</p>

<p>With implications for policymakers, urban practitioners, and the wider public, this research was made possible by an 1+3 ESRC studentship with the <a href="https://steps-centre.org/">STEPS Centre</a>, at the Institute of Development Studies.</p>

      <p>Derived from the Sanskrit word â€˜pratoliâ€™, meaning gate or entrance, a <em>pol</em> is a self-contained neighbourhood housing people of the same caste, religion, or profession. Arranged around a central courtyard, with shared amenities including wells, common toilets, and places of worship, the <em>pols</em> allowed Ahmedabadâ€™s diverse communities to coexist in close proximity, while maintaining seperate ways of life.Â <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">â¤´ï¸Ž</a></p>

      <p>Initiated in the early 2000s, the Sabarmati project set out to revitalise Ahmedabadâ€™s waterfront, developing it as a public space featuring parks, promenades, and commercial zones. Despite its ambitions to enhance the urban environment, the project was criticised for displacing thousands of families living along the riverbanks, while prioritising the interests of the wealthy and powerful.Â <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">â¤´ï¸Ž</a></p>

      <p>Linking insights from post-war appropriate technology, the anti-colonial <em>swadeshi</em> movement, and grassroots innovation, the project positions â€˜appropriatenessâ€™ as an evaluative lens and design criteria for infrastructure projects.Â <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">â¤´ï¸Ž</a></p>
