  <p><strong><em>Bruck</em></strong>, Orcadian dialect word: (verb) to <em>bruck aboot</em>, to rummage in old kirks and cupboards for useful, forgotten things; (noun) <em>bruck</em>, rubbish that never reaches the end of its useful life, all things may yet have a future purpose.</p>

<p>For me, this is about a certain equanimity, not immediately discarding or dismissing things as useless, but anticipating value and future uses for things that may appear worthless. An attitude of curiosity and resourcefulness, looking beyond surface appearances.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What does it mean to approach notetaking as <em>brucking aboot</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>Rummaging through the information presented to us, stashing pieces that seem useful, or might become so in the future. A critical engagement with what to keep and what to discard.</p>

<p>Reevaluating the utility of that deemed waste. A respect for the history and potential of objects (and ideas), with an eye to further extending their lifespan.</p>
