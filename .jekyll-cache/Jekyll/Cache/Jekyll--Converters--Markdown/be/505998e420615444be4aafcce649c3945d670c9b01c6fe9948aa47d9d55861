<blockquote>
  <p>Context often appears as an explanatory staple and normative imperative; a self-evident, black-boxed set of ‘external circumstances’ to which objects must yield (Woolgar and Lezaun, 2013). In his writings on context-aware computing, Paul Dourish takes a different approach, differentiating between <em>representational</em> and <em>interactional</em> interpretations of context (Dourish, 2004). In representational accounts, context denotes the features of a given setting. For interactionalists, however, context is something people <em>do</em>; a localised achievement, with tangible material effects, actively produced through social practice (Seaver, 2015: 1105; Asdal and Moser, 2012: 294; Dourish, 2004: 22). Where calls to contextualise typically assume issues and objects are separate from their surroundings, ‘establishing context’ is a <em>political</em> project, bound up with questions of method and practice (Seaver, 2015: 1106). Since, for interactionalists, context is not self-evident, any analysis of the boundaries between context and content entails choices about what is salient, and ‘where the work of contextualization should cease.’ (ibid.)</p>

  <p>For anthropologists, an early emphasis on holism and local field sites has, in recent decades, yielded to a relational understanding of context as comprising a ‘set of <em>connections</em> between the object of inquiry and its surroundings.’ (Morita, 2014: 215) As anthropologist Nick Seaver observes, while ‘it is common sense that to put things <em>in context</em> is good and to take them out of context is <em>bad</em>’, this has often overshadowed disagreements over what, exactly, context <em>is</em> (Seaver, 2015: 1105). At the same time, much work in STS has been shaped by an imperative to avoid either explaining science by its own internal logic or reducing it to a function of its social environments (cf. Asdal and Moser, 2012). In both fields, a once-common explanatory recourse to context has faltered, finding ‘nothing “beyond” [or outside] with which to explain something else.’ (ibid: 295)</p>
