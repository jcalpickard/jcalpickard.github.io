#### [Hello](hello.md), I'm Justin. I'm an editor and independent researcher, readily <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nerd-snipe">nerd-sniped</a> by edge cases and emerging phenomena.

![Justin Pickard, dithered](http://files.justinpickard.net/images/pages/pickard-dithered.png)

Operating from a home base in the haunted, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/25/bringing-my-family-back-to-the-uk-was-a-bad-decision-but-home-has-its-comforts">flood-prone</a> city of York, I use ethnographic methods to uncover hidden meanings and challenge dominant narratives. In my work life, I've sought out opportunities to pursue open-ended, exploratory research in different settings. I have:

- co-founded a research company
- taught observational methods to varied groups
- facilitated workshops
- participated in a collaborative prototyping residency on human-AI intimacies
- conducted fieldwork on the [cultural politics of infrastructure in Gujarat](phd.md)

These experiences (and others) have instilled a deep appreciation for creative, cross-disciplinary inquiry. Today, I am at my happiest working with others to decipher complex or uncertain situations.

Key research interests include:

- appropriate technology
- communities of practice
- translocal processes
- knowledge bases, repositories, and information retrieval
- improvisation and contingency in the design and use of technology

Having recently tumbled into the gravity well of generative language models, I am also now trying to learn Python.
