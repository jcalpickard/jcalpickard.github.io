#### [Hello](hello.md), I'm Justin. I'm an editor and independent researcher, readily <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nerd-snipe">nerd-sniped</a> by edge cases and emerging phenomena.

Operating from a home base in the haunted, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/25/bringing-my-family-back-to-the-uk-was-a-bad-decision-but-home-has-its-comforts">flood-prone</a> city of York, I use ethnographic methods to uncover hidden meanings and challenge dominant narratives. In my work life, I have sought out opportunities to pursue open-ended, exploratory research in diverse settings and contexts. I've co-founded a research company, taught observational methods, facilitated workshops, and conducted fieldwork on the [cultural politics of infrastructure in Gujarat](phd.md).

Endlessly curious about how people make sense of the world, these experiences have instilled an appreciation for novel, experimental, and cross-disciplinary modes of inquiry. Today, I am at my happiest working with others to decipher complex issues and uncertain situations. Key research interests include appropriate technology, communities of practice, translocal processes, and improvisation and contingency in the design and use of technology. These concepts interlock in examining how technologies get repurposed and remade as they travel between contexts.

Having recently tumbled into the gravity well of generative language models, I am currently trying to learn Python.
