#### [Hello](hello.md), I'm Justin. I'm an editor and independent researcher, readily <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nerd-snipe">nerd-sniped</a> by edge cases and emerging phenomena.

![Justin Pickard, dithered](http://files.justinpickard.net/images/pages/pickard-dithered.png)

Operating from a home base in the haunted, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/25/bringing-my-family-back-to-the-uk-was-a-bad-decision-but-home-has-its-comforts">flood-prone</a> city of York, I use ethnographic methods to uncover hidden meanings and challenge dominant narratives. In my work life, I've sought out opportunities to pursue open-ended, exploratory research in different settings. I have:

- **Co-founded a research company:** Partnered with public and private-sector clients to investigate the diverse contexts in which technologies are imagined, designed, used, and controlled. 
- **Taught observational methods:** Developed and delivered courses and training on ethnographic fieldwork, observational research, and qualitative methods for studying sociotechnical systems and online communities.
- **Facilitated workshops:** Designed and led participatory workshops with diverse stakeholders, using creative, experimental, and collaborative techniques to explore complex issues.
- **Participated in collaborative prototyping:** Joined an interdisciplinary team at MediaLab Matadero to conduct exploratory research and prototyping on artificial intelligence and human-machine intimacy. 
- **Conducted long-term fieldwork:** Carried out ethnographic research on the [cultural politics of infrastructure in Gujarat](phd.md), with implications for policymaking and urban planning.

These experiences (and others) instilled a deep appreciation for creative, cross-disciplinary inquiry. Today, I am happiest working with others to decipher complex or uncertain situations, with a particular focus on:

- **Appropriate technology:** Low-tech, decentralised technologies, tailored to specific contexts and user needs.
- **Communities of practice:** The dynamics of practical knowledge development and dissemination within groups.
- **Translocal processes:** The interplay of local practices and global forces, and how this shapes technologies, policy, and the built environment.
- **Knowledge bases, repositories, and information retrieval:** How people navigate and use information in everyday contexts.
- **Improvisation and contingency:** How people adapt and innovate in real-time, responding to changing conditions through technology design and use.

Having recently tumbled into the gravity well of generative language models, I am also now trying to learn Python.
