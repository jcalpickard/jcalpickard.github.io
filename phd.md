#### My PhD thesis, ‘Appropriate infrastructure and urban sociotechnical change in Ahmedabad, Gujarat’ (2022), offers fresh insights into how infrastructure, urban development, and sociocultural contexts intersect.

Drawing on ten months of field-based research in the city of Ahmedabad, the thesis reveals the social and political lives of infrastructural systems. Ahmedabad's urban landscape provided a revelatory setting to examine issues of appropriateness and equity – from the adaptive reuse of traditional water systems in the old city's densely-packed *pols*[^1], to the import of foreign 'smart city' best practices, and competing visions for developing the Sabarmati riverfront.[^2]

Conceptually, the thesis makes novel contributions to ideas of 'appropriate infrastructure'[^3] and 'sociotechnical flânerie'[^4], while spotlighting three key dynamics shaping contemporary infrastructure projects: mutability (a given system's capacity for adaptation), mobility (the transfer of technologies, plans, and models between contexts), and worlding (how competing visions are enacted through infrastructure). Understanding these, I argue, is crucial for realising more inclusive and just urban futures.

With practical implications for policymakers, urban practitioners, and the wider public, this research was made possible by an 1+3 ESRC studentship with the [STEPS Centre](https://steps-centre.org/), a research unit combining expertise in international development and science and technology policy.

[^1]: Derived from the Sanskrit word ‘pratoli’, denoting a gate or entrance, a *pol* is a self-contained neighbourhood in Ahmedabad's historic core, arranged around a central courtyard, housing people of the same caste, religion, or profession. With shared amenities including wells, common toilets, and places of worship, the *pol* typology allowed Ahmedabad’s diverse communities to coexist in close proximity, while maintaining seperate ways of life. (De, 2016; 2022).

[^2]: Initiated in the early 2000s, the Sabarmati Riverfront Development Project sought to reclaim Ahmedabad's riverbanks, developing them as a public space featuring parks, promenades, real estate, and commercial zones. Despite its stated ambitions to enhance urban life and the quality of the environment, the project was criticised for displacing thousands of families living along the riverbanks.

[^3]: Linking insights from post-war appropriate technology, the anti-colonial _Swadeshi_ movement, and contemporary grassroots innovation, I examine 'appropriateness' as an evaluative lens and design criteria for contemporary infrastructure projects.

[^4]: Sociotechnical flânerie adapts literary and ethnographic traditions of urban observation, tracing infrastructures' material and symbolic configurations from street-level.
