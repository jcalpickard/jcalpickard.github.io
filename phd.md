#### My PhD thesis, ‘Appropriate infrastructure and urban sociotechnical change in Ahmedabad, Gujarat’ (2022), offers fresh perspectives on interactions between infrastructure, urban development, and its sociocultural contexts.

Drawing on 10 months of field-based research in the city of Ahmedabad, I reveal the complex social and political lives of infrastructural systems. Ahmedabad's urban landscape provided a revelatory setting to examine issues of appropriateness and equity – from the adaptive reuse of traditional water systems in the old city's densely-packed *pols*, to the import of foreign 'smart city' best practices, and competing visions for developing the city's Sabarmati riverfront.

At a conceptual level, the thesis makes novel contributions to ideas of 'appropriate infrastructure' and 'sociotechnical flânerie'. Connecting insights from post-war 'appropriate technology' with postcolonial urbanism, I propose appropriateness as an evaluative lens and design criteria for infrastructure projects. Sociotechnical flânerie, meanwhile, adapts literary and ethnographic traditions of urban observation to trace infrastructures' material and symbolic configurations on the streets of the city.

In this, my research spotlights three key dynamics shaping contemporary infrastructure projects: mutability (a given system's capacity for adaptation and reconfiguration), mobility (the transfer of technologies, plans, and models between contexts), and worlding (how competing visions are enacted through practice and materiality). Understanding these, I argue, is crucial for realising more inclusive and just urban futures.

With practical implications for policymakers, urban practitioners, and the wider public, this research was made possible by an 1+3 ESRC studentship with the [STEPS Centre](https://steps-centre.org/) at the Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex.
