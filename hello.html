<h1>Hello. This is how I like to keep in touch.</h1>
<p>• 📧 The best way to contact me is over <a href= "mailto: hello@justinpickard.net">email</a>.</p>
<p>• 🌐 I have a profile on Assemblag.es, a community-focused Mastodon fork administered by off-duty STS researchers.</p>
<p>• 💬 I’m experimenting with virtual office hours, 3 mornings a week. Sign up for a call here.</p>
<p>• 📒 I’m trying to get into the habit of keeping a log of posts and notes. (LINK TO COME)</p>
<p>• 📷 I share photos with friends, family, and trusted others on Instagram.</p>
<p>• 👔 I’m on LinkedIn, though I don’t pretend to understand it.</p>
<p>• ☕ As a rule, I’m normally game for a coffee or a walk — in York, Leeds, or elsewhere in the north of England.</p>
