<p>I wrote my PhD thesis, ‘Appropriate infrastructure and urban sociotechnical change in Ahmedabad, Gujarat’ (2022), at the Institute of Development Studies, UK.</p>

<p>This project addressed the relationship between infrastructure and sociotechnical change, presenting an interpretive account of infrastructure and urban development in the Indian city of Ahmedabad, in the state Gujarat. The study made contributions on theoretical, normative, and methodological grounds; proposing a novel theoretical framework, mobilising ‘apppropriateness’ as a criteria for appraising infrastructure projects, and adapting 19th- and early-20th-century writings on <em>flânerie</em> as a method to explore sociotechnical subjects in contemporary postcolonial settings.</p>

<p>In my interpretive account, I focused on three key aspects — <em>mutability</em>, <em>mobility</em>, and <em>worlding</em> — looking at how urban systems adapt and change, how infrastructure models move between different settings, and how differing interpretations of context shape our technologies and urban landscapes. This is especially relevant in Ahmedabad, a city marked by its postcolonial history, where the interactions between infrastructure and its environment are influenced by rigid and flexible material realities, transnational connections, and a fraught politics of identity.</p>

<p>This work has practical implications for policymakers and urban practitioners, offering fresh perspectives on how infrastructure and context interact. This isn’t just academic; it is a key step in realising infrastructure projects and creating urban development plans that are inclusive and just, tailored to the needs of specific communities.</p>

<p>Funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, this research was part of a 1+3 studentship with the <a href="https://steps-centre.org/">STEPS Centre</a>, a research group uniting international development and science and technology studies.</p>
