## Hello, my name is Justin. I’m an independent researcher and editor, working to challenge dominant narratives and uncover hidden meanings.

I’m an advocate of creative, cross-disciplinary thinking, appropriate technology, and applied research. My work addresses topics including infrastructure, sociotechnical change, maintenance and repair, social movements, technological appropriation, and experimental and collaborative research methods.
