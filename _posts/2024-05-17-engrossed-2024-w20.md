#### Found myself in a machine-facilitated fugue this week; head-down, puzzling my way through new (technical and conceptual) terrain, with a few video calls anchoring me to a shared social reality.
  
##### **Undertakings**:

- **Web development**: A frankly inadvisible amount of website-wrangling throughout this week, including some late-night rabbit-holes and debugging loops. I'm now most of the way through an LLM-supported rebuild, shifting my site away from Wordpress to a Jekyll static site.[^1] With outside machine support, I've been getting more comfortable with working in the command line, Visual Studio Code, etc., and have successfully implemented wiki-style linking, tagging, and a backlinking system, and got a rudimentary vis.js knowledge graph up and running.

- **Latent Intimacies** Check-in with [Vytas](https://vjnks.com/) on Tuesday evening, synchronising our thinking about how to develop some of the outcomes of the "Synthetic Minds" collaborative prototyping residency we were part of back in January-February; also helped him think through some text for an (unrelated) publication later in the week.

- **Choreographing attention**: IM meeting with M (dialling in from a electric vehicle charging station somewhere in Croatia), postponed after I spread myself a bit too thinly last week; talked through plans for getting stuck into the next [Anarchive](https://fo.am/activities/anarchive/) Reader, committing to a focused two-week editorial sprint from the 27th, as something preferable to a more thinly-spread, partial approach.

- **Enxaneta**: Week twoish of a planned six-month Python-for-ethnography collaborative skill exchange with [Tim](https://www.timcowlishaw.co.uk/); reflecting on some on my website-wrangling experiences, and the outcomes of a [field observation exercise](https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta/blob/main/documentation/ethnography/01_ethnographic-observation.md) I'd set; talked a bit about critical technical practice, Britishness abroad, Mariann Vaczi's monograph _Catalonia's Human Towers_, and different approaches to bounding and specifying ethnographic fieldsites, and set some next steps for the coming weeks.

##### **Side-missions**:

- **Dowsing**: Caught an afternoon screening of _[La Chimera](https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/la-chimera-review-digital-release)_ with D over the weekend, which was shaggy and weird, with a dreamy energy that seeped into the rest of the week. Now imagining a dowsing-specific double feature, running it alongside Ben Wheatly's _A Field in England_.

- **Thick presents**: Social catch-up with [Richard](https://www.richardsandford.net/about/), having been in close contact during a flurry of activity putting together an (unsuccessful) funding proposal for a small project on ecological citizenship earlier in the year; we're both going to be at [Anticipation](https://anticipationconference.org/) in September, so useful to get a sense of the kinds of things he's thinking about ([â€»](https://www.richardsandford.net/2024/04/24/thick-present-in-trento/)).

- **On the jagged frontier**: Monthly Friday morning call with [Andrew](https://andrewlb.com/), a little unfocused after staying up into the early hours wrestling with GitHub branches; a wide-ranging chat, covering Wardley maps of dog-breeding as a service, generative AI's [jagged frontier](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=64700), the _Tao of Pooh_, and the 'protocolisation of small team collaboration' (whatever that means).

##### **Next week**:

- Shift from technical web development to tweaking the site's look and feel, and thinking about content strategy
- Another skill exchange session with Tim, going deeper on participant observation and fieldnotes
- Editing work, sketching some 'serving suggestions' for a deconstructed photo book
- Call about an archiving/experimental publishing side-mission
