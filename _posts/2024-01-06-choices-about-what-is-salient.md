#### A couple of paragraphs from the [PhD thesis](../../../../../phd), unravelling context, having drawn too close to the [large language model](http://ai.stanford.edu/blog/understanding-incontext/) and been [spaghettified](https://science.nasa.gov/universe/what-happens-when-something-gets-too-close-to-a-black-hole/).

> Context often appears as an explanatory staple and normative imperative; a self-evident, black-boxed set of ‘external circumstances’ to which objects must yield. (Woolgar and Lezaun, 2013) In his writings on context-aware computing, Paul Dourish takes a different approach, differentiating between _representational_ and _interactional_ interpretations of context. (Dourish, 2004) In representational accounts, context denotes the features of a given setting. For interactionalists, however, context is something people _do_; a localised achievement, with tangible material effects, actively produced through social practice. (Seaver, 2015: 1105; Asdal and Moser, 2012: 294; Dourish, 2004: 22) Where calls to contextualise typically assume issues and objects are separate from their surroundings, ‘establishing context’ is a _political_ project, bound up with questions of method and practice. (Seaver, 2015: 1106) Since, for interactionalists, context is not self-evident, any analysis of the boundaries between context and content entails choices about what is salient, and ‘where the work of contextualization should cease.’ (ibid.)

> For anthropologists, an early emphasis on holism and local field sites has, in recent decades, yielded to a relational understanding of context as comprising a ‘set of _connections_ between the object of inquiry and its surroundings.’ (Morita, 2014: 215) As anthropologist Nick Seaver observes, while ‘it is common sense that to put things _in context_ is good and to take them out of context is _bad_’, this has often overshadowed disagreements over what, exactly, context _is_. (Seaver, 2015: 1105) At the same time, much work in STS has been shaped by an imperative to avoid either explaining science by its own internal logic or reducing it to a function of its social environments. (cf. Asdal and Moser, 2012) In both fields, a once-common explanatory recourse to context has faltered, finding ‘nothing “beyond” [or outside] with which to explain something else.’ (ibid: 295)
