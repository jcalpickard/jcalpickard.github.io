### _To stain the blank page: on blogging and the ship’s log, through the figure of the binnacle._

What is it to ~~start~~ resume blogging now, in the spring of 2023? (Other than it no longer being 1998, that is.) It seems uncertainty is the order of the day. Some speak of a “[polycrisis](https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/have-you-heard-about-the-polycrisis)”, bracing for further ruptures amid mounting turbulence. The digital leviathans founder, the public sphere takes damage, giving way to a froth of invite-only backchannels and social dark pools. Early ripples, perhaps, of [epistemic breakdown](https://www.are.na/justin-pickard/epistemic-breakdown); a peeling-apart of our criteria for appraising truth amid information overload, new synthetic media, and a multiply-breached social contract.

Today, the web is no longer new media, but the backdrop, staging, and atmospherics of lives lived online. Blog is a clipping of a kenning, hinging the network and the archive. And if the novelty of the web is fast-fading, then we should be places more stress on the _log_ half of that hinge.

As a format and genre, the weblog is haunted by the ship’s log. Initially, this was a record of readings from the chip log; a piece of wood on a length of rope, used to calculate a ship’s speed. And both of these logs frequently found their way into the binnacle.  
  
Originally a kind of open cupboard, the binnacle usually had separate compartments for compass, lamp, and hourglass — a composite interface of handheld tools, permitting the seafarer to orient themselves (and their vessel) in space and time.

Beyond its actual use, the binnacle was a convenient container for ship documents and equipment of all kinds:  
  
> ‘Captain Cook kept the keys of the leg-irons in the binnacle, while Captain Bligh thought his a suitable stowage for a pair of pistols.’ (May, 1954: 28)

The ship's log existed alongside navigation devices, and 'within the drifts of other documents on board a typical ship' (Schotte, 2013: 284). More prominent than other written media, it was neither outlier nor exception — only important inasmuch as it enabled (successful) navigation. Initially intended for personal use during voyages, 16th- and 17th-century log-keepers sought flexibility and simplicity, from a 'methodical, concise, and adaptable document, validated by daily use' (ibid: 292).

These navigator-practitioners adopted the ship's log to cope with 'increasing quantities of information … in an age when the scale of their oceanic crossings required them to coordinate ever more information' (Schotte, 2013: 290). But as anthropologist Nick Seaver notes, stories about information overload are as much about shifts in the 'scalar relationship between archives and individuals' as any shared, objective reality: 
  
> Overload requires more than an overwhelming amount of stuff; it requires someone to feel overwhelmed. (Seaver, 2023: 36-37)

In a context of information overload, thinking with the binnacle shows how the blog, like the ship’s log, is an epistemic genre; a class or category of texts linked (in their authors’ eyes, at least) to the dance of knowledge-making. (see [Pomata, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1353/lm.2014.0010)) For me, the motivation is less about ‘[working with the garage door open](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/new-avenues/)’ than logging an itinerary — discerning and recording information, as a personal navigation aid; and for the benefit of those traversing the same (or similarly) turbulent waters.
