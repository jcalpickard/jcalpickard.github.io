### Research interests

My research interests contribute to the goal of advancing knowledge in spaces beyond academia, using ethnographic research as an input into, e.g., design, policymaking, activism, and urban planning.

#### Infrastructure, technology, and society

- **Cultural politics of infrastructure**: How cultural dynamics influence the planning, implementation, and impact of infrastructure projects
- **Urban life and sociotechnical change**: The relationship between urban environments, social structures, and technological development, focusing on patterns of continuity and change
- **Technological jugaad, maintenance and repair**: Improvisation and adaptation in technology use, and the sustaining role of maintenance and repair

#### Politics, policy, and globalisation

- **Social movements, activism, and policy mobilities**: Examining the role of activists and policymakers in shaping infrastructure planning, technology design, and social change
- **Worlding, scalar politics, and translocal processes**: How different actors enact their understandings of the world, exploring the interconnectedness of local and global processes in shaping technologies, systems, and the built environment

#### Applied and experimental methods

- **Applied anthropology and fieldwork**: Applying anthropological techniques to exploratory research in diverse contexts, using field methods and in-situ participant observation
- **Gonzo futures and sociotechnical flânerie**: Using mobile methods and performative writing to observe and interpret the past, present, and futures of sociotechnical systems and urban life
- **Collaborative and experimental methods**: Collaborating with diverse stakeholders and within research teams, embracing creative methodologies to explore innovative, contextually-appropriate responses to real-world challenges

### Professional experience

In my professional life, from independent editing to co-founding a research company, I've sought opportunities to bridge academic insights with real-world applications, pursuing an integrative, multi-pronged approach to knowledge dissemination and impact.

Extending beyond my employment roles, this commitment informs my teaching and volunteering engagements. My ability to switch between academic and non-academic contexts has been an asset, bringing rigour to applied research, and helping students or clients engage with diverse publics. At the same time, the methods I teach align with the hands-on approaches I use in my professional roles, supporting a two-way traffic between pedagogy and practice.
