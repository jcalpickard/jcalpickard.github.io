<h5 id="undertakings"><strong>Undertakings:</strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ritual machines:</strong> Another week, another art application deadline. Teamed up with two remote collaborators for a sprint to meet a commission exploring the intersection of AI and ritual practices. Coordinating across time zones and platforms (Miro boards, web docs, WhatsApp, etc.) posed its own challenges, and we ended up working in a kind of threaded relay, breaking only for dinner and a walk around the block to pet some neighbourhood cats. Don’t know what our chances are, but I’m content that we submitted a convincing proposal, and enjoyed the process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Static site:</strong> Spent most of Tuesday on the ongoing website redesign. I’m doubling down on <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" class="web-link">Inter</a> as a primary typeface, but have tweaked some of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_typographic_features#OpenType_typographic_features" class="web-link">OpenType features</a> to make it more distinctive. Also added some drop shadows to block quotes, to separate them from the surrounding text, and fiddled around with my use of tables. It’s been a relief to make a clean break with WordPress, even as grappling with CSS and typeface weights has felt, at times, like squinting my way through an optometry appointment (“<em>Option A</em>, or … <em>Option B?</em>”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Re/imagining technology:</strong> Set aside a couple of days to work on FoAM’s “<a href="https://fo.am/activities/anarchive/" class="web-link">Anarchive</a>”, getting stuck into our latest multi-author reader, “Re/imagining technology”. I’ve been trying to recontextualise some work from the early 2000s for a contemporary audience, tacking between past insights and future possibilities. From midweek, I shifted from editing to starting work on my own contributions; figuring out the parameters for a planned text sketching one possible scenario for the (near-)future of remote collaboration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Querent.py:</strong> Completed an initial prototype of this tarot-reading programme I’ve been working on, a significant early milestone in my Python journey. Inspired by, and striving to reconcile, the works of Ian Bogost and Alejandro Jodorowsky<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, this undertaking devoured a not-insubstantial chunk of the past fortnight. A central early challenge came in roughing out a data structure flexible enough to capture the tarot’s associative symbolism, with the EAV model emerging as an <a href="https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta/blob/main/documentation/working_notes/02_eav-data-model.md" class="web-link">unexpectedly promising approach</a>, despite its mixed reputation.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="side-missions"><strong>Side-missions:</strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The log-compost continuum:</strong> Published a log entry on <a href="https://justinpickard.net/log/2024/06/17/barefoot-and-malleable/" class="web-link">barefoot coders and malleable software</a>, bridging my recent Python misadventures and longer-standing interests in improvisation and appropriate technology. I’m trying to get back into the habit of writing and publishing on the web, something that seems to involve figuring out what qualifies as a sufficiently “loggable” line of thought.
At a structural level, I’m also trying to get greater clarity on the relationship between my website’s log, as a <a href="https://justinpickard.net/log/2023/04/20/binnacle/" class="web-link">chronological record of discrete observations</a>, and this new “<a href="https://justinpickard.net/compost/" class="web-link">Compost</a>” digital garden, a <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history" class="web-link">mulch</a> of interconnected hunches and notes-to-self; slow, rhizomatic, and iteratively refined.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> The next step is to improve these notes’ navigability, unpicking the assumptions and operational logics of backlinks and the network graph format. I’m aiming to maintain this as a living, breathing knowledge base, running alongside (and underneath) the rest of my site.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Excavating ELIZA:</strong> As part of “Enexata,” mine and <a href="https://www.timcowlishaw.co.uk/" class="web-link">Tim’s</a> “<a href="https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta" class="web-link">sprawling mutual aid skill exchange</a>” (his words), I’ve forked a <a href="https://github.com/wadetb/eliza" class="web-link">Python emulation of ELIZA</a>, the pioneering chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT in the 1960s. To better understand ELIZA’s inner workings, I’ve started annotating the Python codebase. I’m treating this exercise as a form of experimental media archaeology, hunting for traces of the programme’s original social and cultural contexts, while considering how its architecture might be repurposed for contemporary conversational interfaces. Alongside this ELIZA side-mission, I also made some headway on (though didn’t finish) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/01622439241245746" class="web-link">this article</a> on “ugly code” at Russian search engine firm Yandex. Sitting at the juncture of <a href="https://justinpickard.net/compost/valuation/" class="web-link">valuation studies</a> and <a href="https://justinpickard.net/compost/critical-technical-practice/" class="web-link">critical technical practice</a>, the article examines how aesthetic judgments and values shape software development. Aiming to discuss these themes with Tim next week, exploring how they might shape the next stages of our work together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Taming complexity:</strong> This week, I’ve been grappling with the challenge of instilling some kind of order on a firehose of ideas, particularly for the multi-author reader I’m working on with FoAM. Enter “<a href="https://github.com/ycnmhd/obsidian-lineage" class="web-link">Lineage</a>”, an Obsidian plugin approximating much of the functionality of <a href="https://gingkowriter.com/" class="web-link">Gingko Writer</a>.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> As I understand it, the plugin adds a layer of invisible HTML comment “breaks” to markdown files, visually interpreting these as “cards” that can then be hierarchically organised with parent/child dependencies. I’m still experimenting, but the multi-column, drag-and-drop interface could be a game-changer; dramatically reducing the friction in outlining complex texts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Huff-duff:</strong> A standing call with <a href="https://andrewlb.com/" class="web-link">Andrew L-B</a> yielded some reflection on professional legibility in an increasingly fragmented digital landscape. In a <a href="https://andrewlb.com/blog/legible-work" class="web-link">blog post</a> this week, he draws an analogy between WWII-era <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_direction_finding" class="web-link">high-frequency direction finding</a> (HF/DF or “huff-duff”) and the information asymmetries inherent to the challenge of building (assembling?) a career. Like a submarine, he argues, we “transmit” our skills and contributions, hoping to be “detected” by allies and would-be collaborators. But this analogy raises some tricky questions: constant transmission can be exhausting, and risks reducing us to a narrow, distorted slice of our capabilities. This challenge is being compounded by the erosion of mass-userbase social media platforms, with our “transmissions” fragmented across digital spaces. Perhaps the goal isn’t to be a perfectly detectable “submarine”, but to cultivate a network of trusted “huff-duff stations”: allies, mentors, and collaborators who can appreciate our evolving mix of skills; helping us navigate, even as we change course.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> (<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262581462/cognition-in-the-wild/" class="web-link">※</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Boolean loops:</strong> Found myself stuck in an unexpected flow state late Friday night, plumbing a speculative rabbit hole with the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet" class="web-link">newly-launched Claude language model</a>. Sparked by a passing reference in a <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2024/07/the-gods-of-logic-benjamin-labatut-ai/" class="web-link">Benjamin Labateut essay</a>, this, combined with a familiarity with “bools” from my recent Python noodlings, led me to enlist Claude in working through the implications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole" class="web-link">George Boole</a>, father of Boolean logic, surviving an 1864 bout of pneumonia and living into the 1880s. The model’s speculations ranged from the plausible (earlier applications of probability theory in actuarial contexts, more reliable telephone networks) to the offbeat (“True/False cutlery sets”, Boolean gardening, a proliferation of <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/logical-piano-lessons/" class="web-link">logical pianos</a>). As someone who’s been drawn to <a href="/compost/counterfactual-reasoning" class="web-link">counterfactuals</a> since my teenage years, I’m now starting to think about more structured approaches to these machine-assisted thought experiments. And while I’m not yet sure what form this might take, there’s definitely something interesting here.</p>

<h5 id="next-week"><strong>Next week:</strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>Preparing the ground to pivot to phase two of this Python-ethnography collaboration with Tim, having just nerd-sniped him into bootstrapping <a href="https://github.com/timcowlishaw/humus" class="web-link">Humus</a>, a permacomputing-aligned “composting database.”<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>
</li>
  <li>Then to London Monday afternoon, where I’m catsitting while D’s sister and her fiancé brave predicted rain (?) at Glastonbury. I’ll be volunteering at the <a href="https://therai.org.uk/conferences/anthropology-and-education" class="web-link">RAI Anthropology &amp; Education conference</a>, lured in by a run of sessions on how generative AI is starting to sluice into anthropology education and ethnographic methods.</li>
  <li>Catching up with friends and colleagues while in London.</li>
  <li>Likely capping the week with a day at the <a href="https://folklore-society.com/event/digital-folklore-conference/" class="web-link">Digital Folklore conference</a>, before heading back up to York.</li>

  <p>‘A joke that comes up often among AI-skeptical programmers goes something like this: “Great, now no one will have to write code, they’ll only have to write exact, precise specifications of computer behavior…” (implied: oh wait, that is code!) I suspect we’ll look back on this view as short-sighted. LLMs can iteratively work with users and ask them questions to develop their specifications, and can also fill in underspecified details using common sense. This doesn’t mean those are trivial challenges, but I expect to see progress on those fronts.’

<p><strong>Why post this?</strong> At the time of posting, I’m about a fortnight into full-tilt, LLM-supported Python-wrangling, coming from a standing start, as part of this <a href="https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta" class="web-link">skill exchange with Tim</a>. Appleton’s talk neatly threads the needle between my newfound software side-missions and existing interests in improvisation and <a href="/compost/appropriate-technology/" class="web-link">appropriate technology</a>; an overlap I’d begun exploring, tentatively, through the lens of <a href="/compost/situated-software/" class="web-link">situated software</a> (also one of Appleton’s reference points).</p>

<p>Looking ahead, and with an ethnographic hat on, I’m interested in the motives and values of these “barefoot developers”, and how they differ from those of pro software devs. How do principles of <a href="/compost/tinkering/" class="web-link">tinkering</a> and <a href="/compost/bricolage/" class="web-link">bricolage</a> map to these new ways of building (brewing?) software? Can these new generative technologies support those trying to root their tools in local contexts and needs?</p>

<p>And: What new communities and practices might form around “barefoot programming”? Will they track or diverge from existing open source cultures? How will barefoot developers’ outputs be framed and judged? Are we looking at a steeper hierarchy or blurred boundaries? How might this reshape insider/outsider power dynamics and participation in software and technology?</p>]]></content><author><name>Justin Pickard</name></author><category term="quotes" /><category term="computational thinking" /><category term="genai" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[‘Barefoot developers are going to be people who live in this middle bit.

<h5 id="undertakings"><strong>Undertakings:</strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Residency application:</strong> Spent the weekend racing to clarify and complete supporting materials for an artist residency application. Crafting a team proposal with a lead resident, we had to be clear and concrete about our plans and interests, strategising about how best to meet a stringent word limit. We submitted just before the deadline, at midnight on Sunday.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Thick description:</strong> Stayed up late to read Clifford Geertz’s ‘<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20028014" class="web-link">Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese cockfight</a>’, which I had assigned Tim as an introduction to thick description.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Halfway through, I realised I’d never read the entire thing myself, having skipped some key theory modules during an undergraduate joint honours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Exnaneta:</strong> I also worked through some new tutorial materials Tim uploaded to GitHub, using increasingly tortured kitchen analogies to bend my head around some key programming terms (how is a function like a rice-cooker, etc.). Took me a little too long on Friday afternoon to realise the Raspberry Pi <em>was</em>, in fact, working, despite its green light not staying on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Too many flow charts:</strong> Earlier in the week, I followed David’s recommendation to explore <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/" class="web-link">Mermaid</a> diagrams, working up a version of this convoluted custom task management system I’ve been tinkering with since December (see below). This morning, I followed up by generating a <a href="https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta/blob/main/documentation/diagrams/overview.md" class="web-link">ludicrous flowchart</a> outlining the rough plan for mine and Tim’s planned skill exchange.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Puffin hunt:</strong> Spent an extended weekend with D and my parents in the North York Moors, including day trips to Scarborough and the mist-shrouded Bempton Cliffs, where my choice of shorts proved wholly inadequate. Listening to a volley of voice notes from a friend while losing feeling in my fingers, as the rest of our party gazed hopefully over the North Sea, I eventually had to go and wait in the car. Lots of guillemots, fulmars, etc. Everyone except me saw a puffin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Web development:</strong> Building on last week’s efforts, I tweaked and honed the <a href="https://justinpickard.net/compost/" class="web-link">knowledge graph</a> and started populating my <a href="https://justinpickard.net/compost/about/" class="web-link">metaphorical compost heap</a> with rough notes and placeholder content. Having added a ‘last updated’ timestamp to most pages, I’m now grappling with the challenge of rendering my (lengthy, somewhat shaggy) CV in a way that will be intelligible to the casual visitor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Many Knightly Exercises:</strong> Robustly nerd-sniped by a schoolfriend’s brother, a historical European martial arts enthusiast, who reached out for help using machine translation on a 16th-century Bolognese fencing manual.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Grappling with the problem consumed my Thursday morning, as I scoped options for piping the source text into an API vs. his locally hosting an open source machine translation tool.

<strong>Forkable architectures:</strong> Actual full-blown phone call with co-conspirator <a href="https://no2self.net/" class="web-link">Rob</a> on Friday night, after our efforts to connect over video were foiled by limited bandwidth. It was good to catch up; we talked about architectural education, versioning and forkability, the aftermath of this month’s West Midlands mayoral election, and lock-in and obduracy in Birmingham’s housing sector.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="next-week"><strong>Next week:</strong></h5>

<ul>

      <p>Thick description goes beyond simple observation to interpret the meanings and symbols embedded in social actions.

<h5 id="undertakings"><strong>Undertakings:</strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Web development:</strong> A frankly inadvisible amount of website-wrangling throughout this week, including some late-night rabbit-holes and debugging loops. I’m now most of the way through an LLM-supported rebuild, shifting my site away from Wordpress to a Jekyll static site. With outside machine support, I’ve been getting more comfortable with working in the command line, Visual Studio Code, etc., and have successfully implemented wiki-style linking, tagging, and a backlinking system, and got a rudimentary vis.js knowledge graph up and running.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Latent Intimacies:</strong> Check-in with <a href="https://vjnks.com/" class="web-link">Vytas</a> on Tuesday evening, synchronising our thinking about how to develop some of the outcomes of the “Synthetic Minds” collaborative prototyping residency we were part of back in January-February; also helped him think through some text for an (unrelated) publication later in the week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Choreographing attention:</strong> IM meeting with M (dialling in from a electric vehicle charging station somewhere in Croatia), postponed after I spread myself a bit too thinly last week; talked through plans for getting stuck into the next <a href="https://fo.am/activities/anarchive/" class="web-link">Anarchive</a> Reader, committing to a focused two-week editorial sprint from the 27th, as something preferable to a more thinly-spread, piecemeal approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enxaneta:</strong> Week twoish of a planned six-month Python-for-ethnography collaborative skill exchange with <a href="https://www.timcowlishaw.co.uk/" class="web-link">Tim</a>; reflecting on some on my website-wrangling experiences, and the outcomes of a <a href="https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta/blob/main/documentation/ethnography/01_ethnographic-observation.md" class="web-link">field observation exercise</a> I’d set. We talked a bit about critical technical practice, Britishness abroad, Mariann Vaczi’s monograph <em>Catalonia’s Human Towers</em>, and different approaches to bounding and specifying ethnographic fieldsites, and set some next steps for the coming weeks.</p>

    <p><strong>Dowsing</strong>: Caught an afternoon screening of <em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/la-chimera-review-digital-release" class="web-link">La Chimera</a></em> with D over the weekend, which was shaggy and weird, with a dreamy energy that seeped into the rest of the week. Now imagining a dowsing-specific double feature, running it alongside Ben Wheatley’s <em>A Field in England</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Thick presents:</strong> Social catch-up with <a href="https://www.richardsandford.net/about/" class="web-link">Richard</a>, having been in close contact during a flurry of activity putting together an (unsuccessful) funding proposal for a small project on ecological citizenship earlier in the year; we’re both going to be at <a href="https://anticipationconference.org/" class="web-link">Anticipation</a> in September, so useful to get a sense of the kinds of things he’s thinking about (<a href="https://www.richardsandford.net/2024/04/24/thick-present-in-trento/" class="web-link">※</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The jagged frontier:</strong> Monthly Friday morning call with <a href="https://andrewlb.com/" class="web-link">Andrew</a>, a little unfocused after staying up into the early hours wrestling with GitHub branches<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote web-link" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>; a wide-ranging chat, covering Wardley maps of dog-breeding as a service, generative AI’s <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=64700" class="web-link">jagged frontier</a>, the <em>Tao of Pooh</em>, and the ‘protocolisation of small team collaboration’ (whatever that means).</p>

<h5 id="next-week"><strong>Next week:</strong></h5>

<ul>
  <li>Shift from technical web development to tweaking the site’s look and feel, and thinking about content strategy.</li>
  <li>Another skill exchange session with Tim, going deeper on participant observation and fieldnotes.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Context often appears as an explanatory staple and normative imperative; a self-evident, black-boxed set of ‘external circumstances’ to which objects must yield (Woolgar and Lezaun, 2013). In his writings on context-aware computing, Paul Dourish takes a different approach, differentiating between <em>representational</em> and <em>interactional</em> interpretations of context (Dourish, 2004). In representational accounts, context denotes the features of a given setting. For interactionalists, however, context is something people <em>do</em>; a localised achievement, with tangible material effects, actively produced through social practice (Seaver, 2015: 1105; Asdal and Moser, 2012: 294; Dourish, 2004: 22). Where calls to contextualise typically assume issues and objects are separate from their surroundings, ‘establishing context’ is a <em>political</em> project, bound up with questions of method and practice (Seaver, 2015: 1106). Since, for interactionalists, context is not self-evident, any analysis of the boundaries between context and content entails choices about what is salient, and ‘where the work of contextualization should cease.’ (ibid.)</p>

  <p>For anthropologists, an early emphasis on holism and local field sites has, in recent decades, yielded to a relational understanding of context as comprising a ‘set of <em>connections</em> between the object of inquiry and its surroundings.’ (Morita, 2014: 215) As anthropologist Nick Seaver observes, while ‘it is common sense that to put things <em>in context</em> is good and to take them out of context is <em>bad</em>’, this has often overshadowed disagreements over what, exactly, context <em>is</em> (Seaver, 2015: 1105). At the same time, much work in STS has been shaped by an imperative to avoid either explaining science by its own internal logic or reducing it to a function of its social environments (cf. Asdal and Moser, 2012). In both fields, a once-common explanatory recourse to context has faltered, finding ‘nothing “beyond” [or outside] with which to explain something else.’ (ibid: 295)</p>

<p>What is it to <del>start</del> resume blogging now, in the spring of 2023? (Other than it no longer being 1998, that is.) It seems uncertainty is the order of the day. Some speak of a “<a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/have-you-heard-about-the-polycrisis" class="web-link">polycrisis</a>”, while bracing for further ruptures amid mounting turbulence. The digital leviathans founder, the public sphere takes damage, giving way to a froth of invite-only backchannels and social dark pools. Early ripples, perhaps, of <a href="https://www.are.na/justin-pickard/epistemic-breakdown" class="web-link">epistemic breakdown</a>; a peeling-apart of our criteria for appraising truth amid information overload, new synthetic media, and a multiply-breached social contract.</p>

<p>Today, the web is no longer new media, but the backdrop, staging, and atmospherics of lives lived online. Blog is a clipping of a kenning, hinging the network and the archive. And if the novelty of the web is fast-fading, then we should be places more stress on the <em>log</em> half of that hinge.</p>

<p><a href="http://files.justinpickard.net/images/log/2023-04-20-binnacle.jpg" class="web-link"><img class="img-padded" src="http://files.justinpickard.net/images/log/2023-04-20-binnacle.jpg" alt="Compass in binnacle, George Stebbing, 1819"></a></p>

<p>As a format and genre, the weblog is haunted by the ship’s log. Initially, this was a record of readings from the chip log; a piece of wood on a length of rope, used to calculate a ship’s speed. And both of these logs frequently found their way into the binnacle.</p>

<p>Originally a kind of open cupboard, the binnacle usually had separate compartments for compass, lamp, and hourglass — a composite interface of handheld tools, permitting the seafarer to orient themselves (and their vessel) in space and time.</p>

<p>Beyond its actual use, the binnacle was a convenient container for ship documents and equipment of all kinds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Captain Cook kept the keys of the leg-irons in the binnacle, while Captain Bligh thought his a suitable stowage for a pair of pistols.’ (May, 1954: 28)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ship’s log existed alongside navigation devices, and ‘within the drifts of other documents on board a typical ship’ (Schotte, 2013: 284). More prominent than other written media, it was neither outlier nor exception — only important inasmuch as it enabled (successful) navigation. Initially intended for personal use during voyages, 16th- and 17th-century log-keepers sought flexibility and simplicity, from a ‘methodical, concise, and adaptable document, validated by daily use’ (ibid: 292).</p>

<p>These navigator-practitioners adopted the ship’s log to cope with ‘increasing quantities of information … in an age when the scale of their oceanic crossings required them to coordinate ever more information’ (Schotte, 2013: 290). But as anthropologist Nick Seaver notes, stories about information overload are as much about shifts in the ‘scalar relationship between archives and individuals’ as any shared, objective reality:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Overload requires more than an overwhelming amount of stuff; it requires someone to feel overwhelmed’ (Seaver, 2023: 36-37)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a context of information overload, thinking with the binnacle shows how the blog, like the ship’s log, is an epistemic genre; a class or category of texts linked (in their authors’ eyes, at least) to the dance of knowledge-making. (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/lm.2014.0010" class="web-link">Pomata, 2014</a>) For me, the motivation is less about ‘<a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/new-avenues/" class="web-link">working with the garage door open</a>’ than logging an itinerary — discerning and recording information, as a personal navigation aid; and for the benefit of those traversing the same (or similarly) turbulent waters.</p>
