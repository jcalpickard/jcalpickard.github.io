<h3 id="professional-experience">Professional experience</h3>

<p>In my professional life, from independent editing to co-founding a research company, I’ve sought opportunities to bridge academic insights with real-world applications, pursuing an integrative, multi-pronged approach to knowledge dissemination and impact.</p>

<p>Extending beyond my employment roles, this commitment informs my teaching and volunteering engagements. My ability to switch between academic and non-academic contexts has been an asset, bringing rigour to applied research, and helping students or clients engage with diverse publics. At the same time, the methods I teach align with the hands-on approaches I use in my professional roles, supporting a two-way traffic between pedagogy and practice.</p>
