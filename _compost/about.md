This "compost" heap is a collection of evolving notes and half-baked ideas, tended to over time; from bruck and scrap to works in-progress. Inspired by [[permaculture]] and [[digital-gardening]], this is an experiment in working and learning in public, outside of [[project-ontology|project ontologies]] (as much as possible) and gridded organisational time.

A rich personal compost. Umami flavours. All of the rhizomes. Multiple entry points and pathways, no prescribed journeys. Diverse sources and perspectives as fertile ground. Feedback and contributions welcome.
