This "compost" heap is a collection of evolving notes and half-baked ideas, tended to over time. Here, thoughts and concepts grow organically, through iterative honing and cross-pollination; from bruck and scrap to works in-progress. Inspired by [[permaculture]] and [[digital-gardening]], this is an experiment in working and learning in public, but outside of [[project-ontology|project ontologies]] (as much as possible) and gridded organisational time.

This space is a demarcated area within my website, a rich personal compost of decaying leaf matter and umami flavours. Notes here are in various stages of development. Like spreading rhizomes, the "compost" has multiple entry points and pathways. Feel free to explore, but remember this is an active space, subject to growth, pruning, and seasonal changes. 

Feedback and contributions welcome – say [hello](https://justinpickard.net/hello/).

And as a starting point, see my [[current-activities]].

(_The compost is more than just content — it's also a reflection of the tools and practices that shape it. Drafting mostly takes place in VSCode, for now, with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages handling the hosting. A [vis.js](https://visjs.org/) graph provides a node-and-link diagram for navigation, while [jekyll-wikirefs](https://github.com/wikibonsai/jekyll-wikirefs) supplies backlinks, supporting a mesh of interconnected thoughts._)
