A collection of evolving notes and half-baked ideas, tended to over time; from bruck and scrap to works in-progress. Inspired by [[permaculture]], an experiment in working and learning in public, outside of project ontologies and gridded organisational time.

A rich personal compost. Umami flavours. All of the [[rhizome|rhizomes]]. Multiple entry points and pathways, no prescribed journeys. Diverse sources and perspectives as fertile ground. Feedback and contributions welcome.
