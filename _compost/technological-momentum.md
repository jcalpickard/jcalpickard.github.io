Analogous to the inertia of directed momentum. Mass, velocity, goal directedness?

Impacts of the past on a system's future direction (Ewertsson and Ingelstam 2005); isn't easy to turn the (metaphorical) ship.

Early in a given technology's development, it is shaped by social, economic, and political factors, each of which affect the technology's design, direction, and implementation. As the technology matures and becomes more integrated into society, infrastructure, regulatory regimes, etc., it starts to develop its own momentum.

A technology with well-developed momentum may resist attempts at redirection, steering, or change. The supporting systems built around them become deeply entrenched. This makes it difficult to reconfigure or replace the technology, even when potentially better options emerge.

The electricity grid, automobility, etc.
