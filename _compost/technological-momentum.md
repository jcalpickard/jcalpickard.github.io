Analogous to the inertia of directed momentum. Mass, velocity, goal directedness?

Impacts of the past on a system's future direction (Ewertsson and Ingelstam 2005); isn't easy to turn the (metaphorical) ship.

A system with well-developed momentum may resist attempts at redirection, steering, or change.
