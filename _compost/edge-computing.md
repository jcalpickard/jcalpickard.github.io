title: "Edge computing"
stage: bruck
---

A distributed computing paradigm bringing computation and data storage closer to the sources of data, often at the "edge" of the network, to improve response times ([[latency]]?) and save bandwidth. This contrasts with traditional cloud computing, where data is processed in centralised data centres.

- [âŽˆ] Consider parallels with the emergence of distributed telephone exchanges, after central exchanges became a bottleneck.
- [?] How does the decentralisation in edge computing compare to other historical shifts towards localised control?
- [?] What are the key benefits and trade-offs of processing data at the "edge"? When is edge computing most useful?
