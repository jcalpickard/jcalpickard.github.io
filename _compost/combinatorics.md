### ⧢

A branch of mathematics focusing on the study of finite or countable discrete structures. At its core, combinatorics involves selecting, arranging, constructing, classifying, and counting or listing things, often to determine the number of possible configurations that meet specific criteria. 

Objects within a set. Finite sets of discrete elements (as opposed to continuous systems, or gradual change).

This can range from simple problems, such as counting the number of ways to arrange a set of books on a shelf, to more complex issues involving the structure of networks or optimising routes within a system. Fundamental principles of combinatorics include permutations, where the order of arrangement matters, and combinations, where the order does not matter.

_Existence problem_: Does ⬚⬚⬚ exist?  
_Construction problem_:  If ⬚⬚⬚ exists, how can we construct it?  
_Enumeration problem_:  How many ⬚⬚⬚ are there?  
_Optimisation problem_:  Which ⬚⬚⬚ is best?

Ordered selections with repetition? Ordered selections without repetition (permutations)? Underordered selections without repetition (combinations)? Unordereded selections with repetition (distributions)?
