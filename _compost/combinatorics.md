### â§¢

A branch of mathematics focusing on the study of finite or countable discrete structures. 

At its core, combinatorics involves counting, arranging, and selecting objects within a set, often to determine the number of possible configurations that meet specific criteria. This can range from simple problems, such as counting the number of ways to arrange a set of books on a shelf, to more complex issues involving the structure of networks or optimising routes within a system. Fundamental principles of combinatorics include permutations, where the order of arrangement matters, and combinations, where the order does not matter.
