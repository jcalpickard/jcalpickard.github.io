[[field-philosophy|Field philosophy]]/[[ontography]] through [[prototyping]]? Constructing artifacts as philosophical practice.

Analogous to woodworking, but material-agnostic; 'to do carpentry is to make anything, but to make it in earnest, with one's own hands, like a cabinet-maker.' (Bogost 2012)

The products of carpentry are sincere philosophical/investigative outputs; 'not mere accidents, waypoints on the way to something else.' (Bogost 2012) Not a means to an ends. Prototypes embodying and advancing philosophical inquiry, providing fuzzy, speculative glimpses insight into the worlds of objects. Exploring ontology by practicing it? Playful, earnest, and sincere.

Model-making?

Philosophical lab equipment? (what work does this analogy do?)

Engaging directly with the material? Letting material and body serve as co-authors? A tactice, embodied experience.

> An obvious question, then: must scholarly productivity take written form? Is writing the most efficient and appropriate material for judging academic work? If the answer is yes, it is so only by convention.
<cite>— Ian Bogost, _Alien Phenomenology_ (2012)</cite>

> It’s not that writing cannot be interesting. Rather, we might consider that writing is _not the only method_ of engendering interest.
<cite>— Ian Bogost, _Alien Phenomenology_ (2012)</cite>

> However appealing and familiar the usual means of doing philosophy might be, another possible method involves a more hands-on approach, manipulating or vivisecting the objects to be analyzed, mad scientist–like, in the hopes of discovering their secrets.
<cite>— Ian Bogost, _Alien Phenomenology_ (2012)</cite>

> “Major Author Seminar: Herman Melville’s _Moby-Dick_ and 19th Century Technology.” Students read the novel as an encyclopedia of 19th century technology, with each producing a research project on the relation of that technology to 21st century practices.  In addition, they chose several technologies to understand through “hands-on learning” including rope production, knot tying, celestial navigation, candle production, blacksmithing (they forged a harpoon on an anvil), and a 22 ft. plywood model of a whale skeleton cut on a CNC machine eventually donated to a south Atlanta nature center.

Echoes of taxidermy?

- [?] What counts as a "sincere philosophical output" in artifact form? What criteria distinguish it from artistic expression or design prototyping?
- [?] How do you evaluate or validate the knowledge claims or insights embodied in an artifact? What modes of critique or peer review apply?
