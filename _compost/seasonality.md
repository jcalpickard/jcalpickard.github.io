An approach to time as non-homogenous, qualified. Changes or fluctuations that occur in a recurring, predictable cycle over time. Seasonal planning, after [FoAM](https://anarchive.fo.am/wabisabi/seasons/).

A certain base level of predictability. Annual cycles create a kind of "deep time" that transcends individual human lifespans. The repetition of the seasons year after year provides a sense of continuity. Perceptions and meanings of seasons are also culturally constructed, with different societies dividing and defining the seasons in diverse ways.

Seasonal time has a certain "thickness" to it, particularly when compared with the fungible units of clock time. The changing qualities of light, weather, growth, and decay influence our perceptions and experience of the passage of time.

Shifts in the timing, intensity, and variability of seasonal events could disrupt ecological and cultural systems that have evolved in relation to more stable cycles.
