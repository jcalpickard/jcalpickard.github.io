An alternative to the all-pervading, self-perpetuating [[project-ontology]]. With their origins in mythology, military operations, and video gaming, "side-quests" and/or "side-missions" denote secondary objectives or adventures that are not crucial to the progression of the main plot. 

Optional tasks or activities that complement the main storyline or set of objectives. Non-essential, they usually contribute to a broader experience, offering additional depth, rewards, or challenges.

Following other threads, without knowing what will later prove useful. While they may not be of immediate value to the individual, "side-missions" may also contribute to the health of the wider community, field, or practice.

Divergence and exploration. A way of guarding against the lock-ins of path dependency?

- [?] What constitutes a "side-mission" in one's own life? Are hobbies, personal projects, or skill development considered side-missions, or are they integral to personal growth and fulfillment?
