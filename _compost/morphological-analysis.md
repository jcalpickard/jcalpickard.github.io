A structured method for exploring solutions to multi-dimensional, non-quantified complex problems.

Parallels [[combinatorics]], but has an additional evaluative component. A form of [[ontography]], broadly speaking?

Developed by Fritz Zwicky, a Bulgarian-born Swiss astronomer and astrophysicist.

- [?] What were Zwicky's original use cases? (astrophysics, aerospace)

Uses a "Zwicky box", an n-dimensional matrix, where the identified parameters forming the columns, possible values forming the rows, and each cell contains a particular value.

- [?] What tools and techniques are there to help manage the "combinatorial explosion"?

Employs cross-consistency assessment (CCA) to reduce complexity by eliminating unfeasible or contradictory solution combinations.

Involves identifying key dimensions/parameters defining and shaping the problem space. For each dimension, the analyst lists all the possible values, states, or options it can take. This creates a morphological box or matrix.

- [⎈] Explore the potential integration of morphological analysis with foresight and design approaches. How might morphological analysis complement or combine with scenario planning, systems mapping, horizon scanning? Are there opportunities for a more designerly, generative framing of morphological analysis beyond problem-solving?
- [⎈] Explore the potential of computational and software tool support for morphological analysis. Specifically, investigate the role of visualization and interface design in augmenting morphological analysis. How can we create more intuitive/interactive ways to explore morphological fields and configurations?
- [⎈] Examine how morphological analysis handles temporality and change over time. Can it be extended to model dynamic, evolving problem spaces and solution landscapes?
