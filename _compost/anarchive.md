> FoAM's [Anarchive](https://anarchive.fo.am/) is an [[experimental-publishing]] project recontextualising their 20+ years of transdisciplinary work across art, science, nature, and everyday life. This ongoing process combines archival materials with new commissions through a series of themed fascicles, taking an alternative approach to archives, publishing, and knowledge transmission in complex, turbulent times.
