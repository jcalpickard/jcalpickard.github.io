title: "Lay expertise"
stage: bruck
---

Knowledge or skills that individuals acquire outside of formal professional settings.

Contextual, practical knowledge, often informal. A product of first-hand experience, autodidacticism, or direct engagement with the subject at-hand.

Neither standardised nor regulated.

Lay expertise can challenge and/or complement expert knowledge, particularly in situations where scientific consensus may be uncertain or contested (as in [[postnormal-science]] and [[conceptual-emergency]] situations).

Example: Patient advocacy by those with complex or chronic conditions.
