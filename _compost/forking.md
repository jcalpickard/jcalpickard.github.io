In software development, the process of creating a new, independent project by copying the source code of an existing project. The new project, or "fork," diverges from the original, and can be modified or extended without affecting the original codebase.

Forking is a common practice in [[open-source-software]], with customisation, innovation, and collaboration supporting diverse software solutions.

An assertion of independence?

Mitigating the risk of abandonment, but may result in fragmentation, new maintenance demands, and (I guess) versioning issues.

In other contexts, might be about protocols/architectures of the [[side-missions|side-mission]]. Branching paths and subsidiary goals. Thinking about the potential of objects or entities to be split, modified, or used as a starting point for something new (e.g. Linux, sourdough starters).

- [?] What's the difference between a "hard fork" and a "soft fork"?
- [?] Do I need a seperate note on "version control"?
- [&] Unauthorised forking would be [[piracy]], presumably?
- [âŽˆ] Look into how companies use spin-offs to explore new markets or technologies.
