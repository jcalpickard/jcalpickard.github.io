> Part of [[xamota]], Querent.py is an experimental [[situated-software]] tool for personal [[tarot]] practice, supporting introspection and exploration through card-based reflection. This Python-based system incorporates both pre-populated traditional card meanings and user-generated interpretations, allowing for evolution over time. It requires a physical tarot deck, using card draws as triggers for retrieving and generating information.

Querent.py seeks to:

- Explore the intersection between structured data schemas and intuitive, embodied knowledge
- Develop a software tool for card-based personal reflection, approaching the tarot as a "projective instrument" or "portable contemplative device"
- Probe the generative potential of constrained and "forgetful" systems
- Support the evolution of card meanings through user-supplied interpretations, creating a dynamic knowledge base that grows and changes with use
- Explore the concept of "smallness" through local, single-user deployment
- Critique and present alternatives to promissory visions of seamless, on-demand knowledge retrieval
- Contribute to discussions about small data sets and generative AI
