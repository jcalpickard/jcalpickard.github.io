Queer temporality disrupts progressive or cumulative linear conceptions of time.

A disruption of linear, reproductive temporality; circular or recursive; operating through delays, detours, and meanderings; out of sync with "straight time".

Allowing for the coexistence of multiple temporalities within individuals and communities, acknowledging that people can experience time in different ways simultaneously.

Those "outside" or excluded from normative time?

Temporal drag (Freeman); the visceral pull of the past on the present? 

Queer futurity (Muñoz)? The "eccentric life schedule" (Halberstam), outside the dictates of social reproduction?

The AIDS crisis spurred a focus on the urgency of the present moment rather than long-term planning.

- [⎈] Examine queer time in relation to accelerated feedback loops of social media and digital culture.
