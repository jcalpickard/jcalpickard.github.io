Knowledge graphs render [[knowledge-bases]] in a structured graph format, with entities (nodes) representing real-world concepts, objects, or events, and relationships (edges) connecting these in meaningful ways. This allows information to be organised and linked in ways that (in theory, at least) capture meaning and context.
