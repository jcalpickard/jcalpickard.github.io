Concept/slogan first articulated by French philosopher Henri Lefebvre in his 1968 book _Le Droit à la Ville_.

A rallying cry for greater justice, equity, and democracy in urban space.

A collective right (rather than an individual right) to appropriate, reshape, and use urban space. A demand for inclusive and democratic participation in the production of urban space. A critique of the commodification of urban life, and an aspiration for cities as spaces of encounter, difference, and new modes of living.
