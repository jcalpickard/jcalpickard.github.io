> This collaborative project with anthropologist [T.M. Sullivan](https://tmsullivan.co.uk/) compares how people use generative AI and shamanic journeying to solve problems and construct knowledge. We explore the surprising parallels between language models and spiritual entities, introducing the concept of the _panpneumaton_ â€“ a gathering of "all the breaths". This research sheds light how people navigate uncertainty when interacting with entities whose nature and capabilities are not fully understood.
