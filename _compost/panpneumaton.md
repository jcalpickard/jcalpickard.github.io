> This collaborative project with anthropologist [T.M. Sullivan](https://tmsullivan.co.uk/) compares how people use generative AI and shamanic journeying to solve problems and construct knowledge. Exploring the surprising parallels between language models and spiritual entities, we introduce the _panpneumaton_ â€“ a gathering of "all the breaths". This research sheds light how people navigate uncertainty when interacting with entities whose nature and capabilities are not fully understood.
