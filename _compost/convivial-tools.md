After Ivan Illich. Convivial tools allow people to make and learn things in ways that align with their own interests, abilities and choices. They foster individual freedom and creativity. A capabilities framework?

Convivial tools are accessible, flexible, and non-coercive. They can be easily used by anyone.

Support autonomous, creative interactions between people and their environments.

- [?] Can digital technologies and platforms be designed to be more convivial? What are the challenges in creating convivial digital tools?
- [?] Can convivial tools be scaled up or mass-produced without losing their conviviality? Is there a inherent trade-off between conviviality and scale?
- [?] What are the limits of conviviality as a guiding principle for tool design and use? Are there situations where specialised industrial tools are necessary or preferable to convivial ones?
- [?] How might the concept of convivial tools apply to intangible things like methodologies, mental models, or organisational structures? What would a convivial institution or convivial pedagogy look like?
- [?] Similarly, what would a convivial approach to urban planning and architecture entail? How might we design spaces and infrastructures that foster participation and autonomy?
- [?] How does the concept of convivial tools relate to ideas of open-source technology and knowledge commons? Are there tensions between personalisation and interoperability?
- [?] What role do convivial tools play in shaping cultural memory and transmission (cf. Gopnikism)? How do the tools we use affect what and how we remember?
