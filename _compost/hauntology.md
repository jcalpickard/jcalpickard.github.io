How pasts haunt the present; takes a "deconstructive" approach to questions of being, presence, absence. Figure of the ghost.

Temporal disjunction. Disruption of linear temporalities, where past, present, and future become entangled, and time is out of joint. Uncanny repetitions. Abandoned or decaying spaces.

Cultural memory? Nostalgia and melacholy.

Mark Fisher, Simon Reynolds, and others applied it to music in the 2000s. [Ghost Box](https://www.ghostbox.co.uk/), [Warrington-Runcorn New Town Development Plan](https://warringtonruncorn.com/), Boards of Canada.

- [?] Is hauntology specifically tied to the British cultural experience? Can the concept be meaningfully extended to other geographic and spatial contexts?
- [?] Are hauntological aesthetics and "nostalgia for lost futures" a response to political and cultural impasses of the present?
- [?] Can hauntology be deployed for emancipatory or utopian ends, or does it ultimately reflect a pessimistic, melancholic orientation to culture and history?
