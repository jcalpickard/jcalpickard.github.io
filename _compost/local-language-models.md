> **July 2024:** _Upgraded my Framework 13 laptop's RAM and SSD in anticipation of experimenting with locally-hosted generative language models; looking to (practically) apply some concepts emerging from mine and Tom's [[panpneumaton]]/[[panpneumatics]] research._

Interested in pushing the boundaries of what's possible with limited resources, through techniques like [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685).

Thinking about "loose couplings" in software ecosystems.

- [?] How might the constraints of local hosting on personal hardware shape the development of more "appropriate" or "situated" AI technologies?
- [?] How might the ability to easily fine-tune models for personal use reconfigure the relationship between users and AI systems?
- [?] How can we design a system that "gathers" and orchestrates multiple models while maintaining transparency about which model is contributing what?
