A two-dimensional boundary or interface that separates or delineates one thing from another.

> Early modern surfaces, scientifically and atomically speaking, were discovered to be a hilly, steamy rind of reality, characterized less by a common-sense solidity of objects than by their poor borders, leaky in all directions.

Length and width, but negligable depth. Key to how we perceive and conceive of objects as distinct entities occupying space.

Sites of interaction, inscription?

Porosity and permeability?

Metaphorically, and sometimes literally, _skin_.

Surface of the earth. Writing surfaces?

- [⎈] In computer graphics, 3D objects are represented by their surface geometry, often approximated as a polygon mesh. Simulating the appearance of surfaces under different lighting is a key challenge. How has our understanding of real surfaces informed digital surface representations and rendering techniques?
- [⎈] Surfaces can be engineered to have special properties; hydrophobic, self-cleaning, anti-microbial, etc. What are some functional surfaces in nature?
