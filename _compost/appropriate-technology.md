The concept of "appropriate technology" stresses the importance of designing and implementing technologies that are ‘tailored to fit the [prevailing] psychosocial and biophysical context’ (Willoughby 1990). Prioritising the needs, resources, and capabilities of the intended users and their communities.

Typically: small-scale and decentralised, labour-intensive, energy-efficient, environmentally sustainable, flexible, legible, affordable, using locally available resources as much as possible, and designed for on-the-spot maintenance.

Designed to be implemented at a local or community level?

Challenges the notion of a "one-size-fits-all" approach to technological development. Instead, it stresses the importance of understanding and responding to the unique contexts and needs of different communities and environments.
