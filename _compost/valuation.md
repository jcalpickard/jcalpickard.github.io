Specifically, valuation a a social practice.

Thinking about how the value or values of different entities (objects, services, ideas, etc.) are constructed, evaluated, and afforded meaning through various mechanisms, and by different actors.

How people, things, ideas/ideals are ordered.

"Value" as a noun, vs. "value" as a verb.

"Value" (singular) vs. "values" (plural).

"Valuation" vs. "evaluation".

Evolution/extinction of an earlier, apparently settled regime of values, changing what is publicly valued in society. Think talk of "[[degrowth]]" and "post-materialist values"?

Assessment tools? Multi-criteria mapping?

Transactional regimes? Web-based rating and recommendation systems?

- [?] How is valuation entangled in the organisational and technological processes of economic exchange?
