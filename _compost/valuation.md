Specifically, valuation a a social practice.

> McConnell, the glass expert, provided long accounts of manufacturing histories, explaining, for example, the significance of Venice not only as a place of production but also as a node in international commercial transactions. Later, he held a glass fish to his chest and exclaimed, “it's not worth anything, next to nothing, but it's Italian made. They're still being made today but represents (sic) the aspirations of the working class moving into the middle classes in the 1960s/1970s.”

> Rather than expert evaluations dominating or usurping object valuation, the [Antiques] Roadshow Event reveals a more organic, and often collaborative encounter. Experts are sensitive to how their economic valuations may disrupt people's emotional connections to their possessions and make efforts to balance use value or sentimental value, playing down economic worth when necessary. Owners end up taking what they need from these encounters, whether expanded stories to tell, rejections of calls to use items, or even help in finding a reason to let objects go. Together these experiences demonstrate how value is not a measurement, but a dimension of the thing and its context.
