Critical technical practice (CTP) is a concept that advocates for a reflective and critical approach to technology design and development. Introduced by Phil Agre, it emphasises the integration of critical theory and technical practice, as a way of producing technologies that are socially and ethically sound. 

> A critical technical practice rethinks its own premises, revalues its own methods, and reconsiders its own concepts as a routine part of its daily work. It is concerned not with destruction but with reinvention. Its critical tools must be refined and focused: not hammers but scalpels, not a rubbishing of someone else but a hermeneutics and a dialectics of ourselves.

1. Identify the core metaphors and assumptions of the field
2. Notice what is marginalised or left out
3. Invert the dominant metaphors, to bring the margins to the centre
4. Embody alternatives as new technologies

Aim is to develop a "split identity", with one foot in the craft of technical creation, and the other in reflexive critique.

Initially, CTP was a response to the limitations of 20th-century AI research. Agre's work at the MIT AI Lab, particularly his collaboration with David Chapman, laid much of the groundwork for his approach. His critical stance was influenced by his dissatisfaction with the intellectual conservatism of AI and its limited sense of historical context.
