Extrapolating from Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's essay "Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature" (1975).

_Minor literature_ involves using a major language in strange, intensive ways, making the language "stutter" and "take flight"? It uncovers the revolutionary potential within major literatures; the "becoming-minor" of great works.

A relative position to major/big technology; equally a question of scale and of power. Minor feelings, and [[rearguard-yin-tactics]]? Not just critical/oppositional; seeking a more slippery, oplique positioning.

- _Deterritorialisation_: Using major technological systems in unconventional ways
- _Political immediacy_: Inherent political implications
- _Collective value_: Emphasis on community and shared experiences
- _Intensive utilisation_: Exploiting inner tensions within existing technologies

The struggle for autonomy of expression. Minor technologies can serve as sites of resistance or alternatives to major technologies, offering different visions of how technology can be developed and used.

While "minor" doesn't _necessarily_ mean small in scale, it often implies operating at a more human-centric or community level. Minor technologies frequently involve peer-to-peer interactions rather than client-server models. 

> the quality of being minor … does not only involve using master frameworks to express alternative views, but can also include exploring other formats of engagement that are distributed and non-linear.

> Minor tech … becomes cumulative through this sense of the collectivity forming at the core of its production, which generates active solidarities across communities, practitioners and artifacts – a solidarity that cements itself as a collective utterance.

Repurposing existing systems and platforms as 'technologies of possibility'; counterpoints to the 'universal ideals embedded in technologies' (Fartan 2023).

At the same time, the concept of minor technologies encourages us to look beyond stable, categorical definitions of "technology," considering a wider, more diverse range of practices and tools that shape our relationship with the world. Zines, community/pirate radio, bicycles, the Fediverse, samizdat, demoscene, mesh networks, circuit bending, analogue synths, Melanesian cargo cults, esolangs, and certain open-source software projects.

- [⎈] How can we distinguish "minor" technologies from "major" ones? Consider how this distinction plays out in practical scenarios. Can you identify contemporary "minor technologies" in everyday life or specific fields (e.g., education, healthcare, communication)?
- [?] Are minor technologies always intentionally created as alternatives, or can they emerge organically, from unintended uses of major technologies?
- [?] How do minor techs reveal latent potentials in major systems?
- [?] Are there historical precedents of minor technologies effecting political change?
- [&] Compare with: [[appropriate-technology]], grassroots innovation?
