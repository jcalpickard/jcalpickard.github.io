Real, actually-existing places, not utopias. Worlds within worlds that reflect and unsettle?

Ships, cemeteries, bars, prisons, gardens, museums, libraries, funfairs, lazarettos.

Incompatable and contradictory elements.

Systems of opening/closing that isolate them yet make them permeable?

Heterochronic? "Bottle episodes"?

Crisis heterotopias are sacred or forbidden places for people in a state of crisis. Heterotopias of deviation are for individuals who deviate from the norm.

- [?] Are heterotopias sites of resistance or containment?
- [?] How do heterotopias arrange and manage otherness, difference, and deviation in society?
