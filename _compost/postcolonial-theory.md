A critical approach examining the cultural, political, and social effects of colonialism and imperialism, with a focus on analysing the legacy and ongoing impacts of colonial power structures on formerly colonised societies and peoples.

Critiquing the discourses that sustained colonialism and aims to reclaim histories, identities, and ways of knowing that were suppressed/marginalised under colonial rule. In summary, postcolonial theory provides a critical framework for interrogating the legacies of colonialism, deconstructing dominant Western narratives and representations, and centering the voices, perspectives and knowledge systems of formerly colonised peoples and societies.
