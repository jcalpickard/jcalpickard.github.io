title: "Ruderality"

The ecological characteristic of specific plant species capable of thriving in disturbed environments. 

These species, known as ruderal species, are adapted to conditions where natural vegetation is disrupted, whether by human activity or natural events.

These species exhibit fast growth rates and high reproductive outputs, quickly establishing and dominating newly available niches.

More broadly, could speak to resilience, adaptability, and the ability to thrive in disrupted or fast-changing environments. Grassroots movements, entrepreneurship, the informal economy.

- [âŽˆ] Are there implications of ruderality for thinking about disaster recovery? The capacity of certain communities to be the first to rebuild and rebound after catastrophic events could be viewed through a "social ruderality" lens.
- [?] How do informal networks and community organisations provide support and resources in disrupted environments?
- [?] What forms or instruments of governance are capable of maintaining stability and adaptability in the face of social and political disturbances?
- [?] What design strategies can be used to create technologies that are resilient and adaptable to resource-constrained or variable conditions?
