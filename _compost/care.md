Ethical framework stressing the importance of relationships, context, and individual needs, and committed to maintaining and nurturing sustaining social connections.

- attentiveness
- responsibility
- responsiveness

Attending to the affective, embodied, and contextual dimensions of moral life. Rooted in the details of specific, actually-existing relationships and responsibilities, and standing against the methodological individualism of the autonomous, self-sovereign actor.

Focuses on the question of 'how to respond?' Resists hard and fast, fixed principles. Demands [[tinkering]] and adjustment.
