title: "Media archaeology"
stage: bruck
---

Interdisciplinary field looking at the history, theory, and cultural impact of media technologies and practices.

Challenges the notions of technological progress, taking a non-linear, non-teleological approach to media history, and "excavating" alternative paths, dead-ends, discontinuities, ruptures, imaginary media concepts, and cyclical patterns.

Investigates the interplay of old and new media, highlighting how past forms and ideas are remediated or recycled.

Strong emphasis on materiality, infrastructures, archives, "dead" media, storage technologies?
