> My duckyPad trials are a series of open-ended experiments using an [open-source mechanical macropad](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/blob/master/README.md) as a lens to explore the cognitive, philosophical, and practical dimensions of [[hci]]. Balancing reflective practices with real-world utility, these explorations serve as a personal laboratory for context-specific interaction design, where technology is both tool and subject of study. Embracing exploratory tinkering and frictive interactions, I explore how the affordances of a malleable interface can shape my own digital practices and thought processes, supporting metacognition. The result is a personal laboratory for context-specific interaction design, with technology as both tool and subject.

Assuming a continually evolving setup, rather than a fixed configuration, but not sure how best to support this.
