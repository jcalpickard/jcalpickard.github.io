> My duckyPad trials are a series of open-ended experiments using an [open-source mechanical macropad](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/blob/master/README.md) as a lens to scrutinise the cognitive, philosophical, and practical dimensions of [[hci]]. Balancing reflective practices with real-world utility, through exploratory tinkering, I'm exploring how this malleable interface can shape my own digital practices, thought processes, and metacognition.

Assuming a continually evolving setup, rather than a fixed configuration, but not sure how best to support this.
