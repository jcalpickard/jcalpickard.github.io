Looking to use the [duckyPad](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/blob/master/README.md) as a platform for exploring novel [[hci|human-computer interactions]], rather than solely for productivity.

A way to create space for self-reflection and metacognition, introducing (generative) friction into my workflows?

Assuming a continually evolving setup, rather than a fixed configuration, but not sure how best to support this.

A more exploratory, research-oriented approach. Experimental interface for exploring permacomputing principles, a tool for "embodied" coding. Support for other activities?
