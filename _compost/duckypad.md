> My duckyPad explorations are a series of loosely joined personal experiments exploring the cognitive, philosophical, and practical dimensions of [[hci]]. Using the [duckyPad](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckyPad/blob/master/README.md) open-source mechanical macropad as a platform, these experiments reflect on how situated hardware design can influence digital practices and thought processes. By prioritising experimentation over optimisation, this ongoing inquiry serves as a unique case study in personal, context-specific interaction design.

A way to create space for self-reflection and metacognition, introducing (generative) friction into my workflows?

Assuming a continually evolving setup, rather than a fixed configuration, but not sure how best to support this.

A more exploratory, research-oriented approach. Experimental interface for exploring permacomputing principles, a tool for "embodied" coding. Support for other activities?

My duckyPad explorations comprise a series of loosely joined personal experiments investigating the cognitive, philosophical, and practical dimensions of human-computer interaction. Using the open-source duckyPad mechanical macropad as a platform, these experiments reflect on how situated hardware design can influence digital practices, thought processes, and metacognition. By prioritizing experimentation and generative friction over mere optimization, this ongoing inquiry serves as a unique case study in personal, context-specific interaction design, blending permacomputing principles with cutting-edge technology exploration.
