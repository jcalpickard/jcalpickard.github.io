> The artist keeps hoping, the bear says, and catches me by surprise. I screenshot it. I tell my partner about it. It feels significant for a moment, then we move on. Months later, I come across the screenshot and relive the pleasant sensation of being taken out of a mundane moment of passive learning and into a more activated state. The accidental poetics of the Duolingo bear gave an interesting texture to an otherwise flat encounter.

A screenshot is an abstract digital artifact or object. It does not have a physical, material existence

**Elements of a screenshot:**

- Captured content: The actual text, images, videos, or interface elements displayed on the screen that are captured in the screenshot; a static visual reproduction of the original dynamic screen content 
- Metadata: Additional data about the screenshot such as time and date of capture, device used, image resolution, and file format; provides context about the screenshot's creation[^1]
- Embedded context: Screenshots capture content within the surrounding visual context of the user interface, revealing spatial relationships between elements that provide meaning and guide interpretation

"Shot" from photography, meaning a single exposure.

Captures and represents a particular state or configuration of visual information as it appeared on a screen. A representation or model of a real-world phenomenon (the screen display) at that specific moment in time.

While a screenshot itself is static, it depicts the dynamic visual output of an interactive computing system. Freezes and reifies a transient state within an ongoing computational process?

Often a depiction of the [[gui]]?
