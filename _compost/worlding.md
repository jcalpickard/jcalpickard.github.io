Propositions about context; the ‘attribution of world-like characteristics to scenes of social encounter.’ (Tsing 2010)

Challenging the notion of a singular, human-centered world, in favour of a multiplicity of worlds co-created (enacted?) by various entities, through their interactions and relationships.

Against a 'one-world' metaphysics (Law 2015).

Processes by which the near and far ‘intermingle’, such that ‘apparently diverse scenes may become part of the same picture, or narrative.’ (Hastrup 2013) How different actors ‘locate the contours and parameters of the contexts in which they act.’ (Stead 2016)
