Unconventional approaches to creating, distributing, and engaging with published works, often challenging or redefining what constitutes a "book" or "publication" in a "post-digital" context.

New structures, formats, modes of interaction. Networked practices, e.g. use of software for version-control?

Alternative approaches to authorship, dissemination, peer review and evaluation.

Creating new "publics"?

I'm particularly interested in how this approach could usefully be applied to [[knowledge-graphs]], [[knowledge-bases]], etc.
