> "Counterfactual computers" is an open-ended, experimental writing project exploring alternative trajectories of computing through an extensible series of "case" narratives. By reimagining the configuration and development of computational devices across varied contexts, this work challenges dominant technological narratives, highlighting hinge points and latent potentials in the history of computing.

This project takes a multi-pronged approach, combining historical research, LLM-supported morphological analysis ([[gnomon|â€»]]), expert engagement, and counterfactual reasoning techniques. This combination of methods allows for the relatively rapid construction of plausible alternative histories that are both imaginative and grounded in historical possibility.

Drawing on insights from [[postcolonial-technoscience]], this work aims to detach our understanding of computing from exclusively Euro-American contexts. By imagining computers that could have emerged from different cultural, social, and economic niches, "Counterfactual computers" sets out to unsettle our conception of what computing is, has been, and could yet be.

Focusing first and foremost on hardware, "Counterfactual computers" approaches computers as objects with their own biographies and cultural significance. This emphasis allows the work to explore how the physical form of computers shapes and is shaped by prevailing contexts, embodying and perpetuating specific social structures and cultural values.

Blurring the boundaries between historical research and speculative fiction, "Counterfactual computers" will:

- Highlight the role of contingency in technological development
- Explore how different cultural, social, and economic factors could have shaped alternative computing paradigms
- Support critical reflection on the relationship between technology, society, and culture
- Prototype and refine approaches to computer-supported [[counterfactual-reasoning|counterfactual thinking]]
- Uncover possible solutions to contemporary challenges by revisiting paths not taken

By challenging narratives of un progress and creating space to reflect on the cultural assumptions baked into current computing paradigms, "Counterfactual computers" looks to contribute to nuanced, inclusive discussions about technology and society.
