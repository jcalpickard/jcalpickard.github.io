> "Counterfactual computers" is an open-ended, experimental writing project exploring alternative trajectories of computing through an extendable set of "case" narratives. By reimagining the configuration and development of computational devices across varied contexts, this work challenges dominant technological narratives, unearthing hinge points and latent potentials in the history of computing.

This project employs a multifaceted approach, combining historical research, AI-supported morphological analysis (?), expert engagement, and counterfactual reasoning techniques. These techniques allows for the construction of plausible alternative histories that are both imaginative and grounded in historical possibility.

Drawing on insights from [[postcolonial-technoscience]], this work aims to detach our understanding of computing from exclusively Euro-American contexts. By imagining computers that could have emerged from diverse cultural, social, and economic environments, "Counterfactual computers" seeks to unsettle our conception of what computing is, has been, and could yet be.

Focusing primarily on hardware, the project approaches computers as objects with their own biographies and cultural significance. This emphasis allows me to explore how the physical form of computers shapes and is shaped by prevailing contexts, embodying and perpetuating specific social structures and cultural values.

Blending historical research and speculative fiction, "Counterfactual computers" seeks to:

- Highlight the role of contingency in technological development
- Explore how different cultural, social, and economic factors might have shaped alternative computing paradigms
- Support critical reflection on the relationship between technology, society, and culture
- Prototype and refine approaches to computer-supported [[counterfactual-reasoning|counterfactual thinking]]
- Uncover possible solutions to contemporary challenges by revisiting paths not taken

By challenging narratives about technological progress and fostering reflection on the cultural assumptions embedded in current computing paradigms, "Counterfactual computers" aims to contribute to more nuanced, inclusive discussions about technology and society.
