Concept developed by Stewart Brand in his book, _How Buildings Learn_. A way of understanding different rates of change and the longevity of components in a system.

As applied to buildings: site, structure, skin, services, space plan, stuff.

The interactions between these layers are crucial for understanding the dynamics of change. Highlights the importance of considering cross-cutting timescales when designing, constructing, and maintaining systems.
