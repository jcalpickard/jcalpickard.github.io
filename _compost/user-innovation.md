Potentially contingent on a form of [[situated-knowledge]]? Link to ideas of "proximal design"?

Users innovate to satisfy their own unique, idiosyncratic needs; those neglected by existing market offerings. 
They have unique information about their needs and are motivated to find solutions to those needs.

Von Hippel coined the term "sticky information" to describe information that is costly to transfer from its source to another location. He argues that because users possess unique, context-specific knowledge about their needs, they are better positioned to innovate new products, while manufacturers focus on improving existing products.

Central role for "lead users" (Von Hippel, 1986)?

Users often freely share their innovations with others, through "free revealing." This sharing can lead to widespread adoption and further development?

User innovation is particularly evident in pro-am spaces; think about medical devices, scientific instruments, software, extreme sports equipment.

- [?] How are new technologies like generative artificial intelligence, 3D printing, and remote co-creation platforms accelerating and/or reshaping user innovation?
