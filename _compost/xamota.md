> "[Xamota](https://github.com/timcowlishaw/enxaneta/tree/main/activities/xamota)" is an experimental research project exploring the interplay of structured data and intuitive knowing through two locally-deployed software tools: [[Querent.py]] (a Python-based tarot tool) and Humus (a Rust "composting" database). Using reflexive software development as a form of ethnographic inquiry, this collaboration with [Tim Cowlishaw](https://www.timcowlishaw.co.uk/) investigates alternative, "small" data practices that challenge conventional ideas of persistence and retrieval.

Part of [[enxaneta]], an exercise in [[bogostian-carpentry]] and [[degrowth]] thinking.
