Again, after Ian Bogost.

- [?] What are the origins, key texts, salient contexts of this work?

Key points/ideas:

- Processes and rules in interactive systems can embody or encode specific ways of thinking about how real-world systems work; by interacting with the system, users learn about those worldviews (?)
- Procedural rhetoric is the art of persuading through these rule-based representations and interactions; games can make claims about how things work by modeling processes
- Procedural representation is a new form of rhetoric, distinct from verbal, visual or written rhetoric; it relies on computation to execute processes and allows interaction
- Procedural rhetoric may support existing cultural, social and political positions, but it can also challenge and change them, with significant effects on the user or player's thinking
