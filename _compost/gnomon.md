Inspired by [Paragonday](https://paragonday.systems/), FoAM's notes on [seasonal planning](https://anarchive.fo.am/wabisabi/seasons/), and anthropological research on "time-tricking."

[ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/) is part of the solution? Keen, too, to experiment with [[adaptive-roadmapping]], but at a personal (rolling, 3-month?) scale.

- Rejecting rigid, corporate-style "gridded" time management in favour of more organic, context-sensitive approaches
- Inspired by time-blocking, but seeking a more organic approach to task management
- Optimised for personal use
- Multi-scalar, able to zoom in and out, handling both day-to-day priorities and longer-term planning
- Recognising that not all hours are equal and that different activities require different qualities of attention and energy
- Aligning planning with natural rhythms and personal energy cycles
- Blurring the boundaries between professional and personal time to foster a more holistic approach to time use
- A hybrid digital/analogue system, supported by custom "tiny tools" and practices as appropriate

Trying to figure out a balance of structure and flexibility. The challenge is in creating a system that is freeform enough to be "feral" and structured enough to be useful for long-term planning and task management (and then sticking to it). Want to incorporate regular rhythms (perhaps aligned with natural cycles) while responding to the flows of work and life.

Thinking about "vectors," as somewhere between heuristics and enduring priorities.
