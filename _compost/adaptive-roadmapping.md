An approach to strategic planning that creates and maintains high-level visual plans, allowing for continuous updates and adjustments based on new information and changing circumstances.

Key features: dynamic visualisation, real-time data integration, and the ability to pivot quickly to respond to emerging opportunities and challenges.

- emphasises flexibility and iterative development
- [?] a formalised, systematised version of [[muddling-through]]?
- [?] what _is_ a roadmap, in this context?

| Aspect                  | Traditional static planning                                                                 | Adaptive roadmapping                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Flexibility & adaptability**                 | Rigid and inflexible; quickly outdated; plans are rarely updated                                      | Highly flexible; plans continuously updated based on new information; responsive to changes             |
| **Data integration**            | Limited to initial data; no real-time updates                            | Incorporates real-time data to ensure current and accurate information         |
| **Visualisation**               | Static documents (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) that are not interactive                   | Dynamic and interactive visual tools that are easy to modify and update[^1]              |
| **Collaboration & engagement**               | Non-collaborative; lacks real-time feedback; often unengaging and hard to communicate                                     | Collaborative platforms allowing real-time contributions; engaging and transparent |
| **Decision-making & development**             | One-time planning event; long intervals between updates; slow and reactiven                                           | Fast and proactive; continuous, iterative planning cycles, based on the latest inputs                         |
| **Outcome focus**               | Focuses on delivering pre-set plans rather than achieving outcomes                | Focuses on achieving outcomes and adapting plans to meet those outcomes     |
