> My dream is to work on ambitious projects with 2-20 core contributors over 1-100 months per project. When the project is complete and stable and beautiful, all of us stop working on it and move onto different projects. If built on a small/stable/well-defined platform/VM, it should work indefinitely (like Mario Kart 64). And then we celebrate our launch together and say goodbye or maybe do another project together and adopt some starry-eyed junior engineers and we all learn together and life is good.

> When we consider projects not as a universal phenomenon, but as a historically specific social form, what other kinds of analysis become possible?
<cite>— Andrew Graan, "[What was the project? Thoughts on genre and the project form](https://doi.org/10.1080/17530350.2022.2087716)" (2022)</cite>

Core definition of the project: 'a recognizable style of purposive action that tethers genres of logistical planning and management to visions of the world made somehow different.' (Graan 2022: 736)

Combining two core aspects: '_logistical_ practical reasoning and _visionary_ aspirational ends.' (ibid.)

Choosing to "de-projectify" some undertakings? (as [[side-missions]], or otherwise)

- [?] What does it mean to look at the project as a _genre_?
