_Chronos_ and _kairos_ embody distinct but complementary dimensions of temporal experience. _Chronos_ is the quantitative, linear, and measurable aspect of time; the objective and sequential progression of moments, in clock and calendar time. _Kairos_ introduces a qualitative, opportune dimension to time, emphasising the subjective, experiential, and contextual aspects of significant moments.

The 'optimal' moment for action is shaped by an alignment of circumstances, individual judgement, and cultural context.

While _chronos_ provides a framework for organising events, _kairos_ highlights the nuanced, contingent pivotal moments that shape experience. Their interplay deepens our appreciation of history, where the linear passage of time coexists with the dynamic contingency of transformative moments.

Example: The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989; an event that can be understood through the lens of sequential events and broader systemic factors (_chronos_), as well as the essence of the moment, captured in spontaneous decisions, expressions of emergent, collective agency, and transformative change (_kairos_).

_Kairos_ seems to open up possibilities for transformation, both personal and societal, in ways that _chronos_ does not. _Kairos_ may be key to meaningful change?

- [?] How could organisations and institutions create more space for kairotic time?
