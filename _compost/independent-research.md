title: "Independent research"
stage: bruck
---

Scholarly or scientific work conducted outside of traditional institutional settings, without formal affiliation or oversight. Self-directed. 

Intellectual freedom and autonomy, but issues with legibility and credibility, few opportunities for career advancement, collaboration, peer review, knowledge-sharing within a community of inquiry? Difficulties accessing funding.

Open access and [[experimental-publishing]], preprint servers, etc.?

Accountability mechanisms? (Need to look more at recent work on "community peer review".)

- [?] At a meta/infrastructural level, what alternative arrangements and support systems are emerging to facilitate independent research?
- [?] How might the rise of open research practices and alternative dissemination channels reshape the landscape of independent research?
