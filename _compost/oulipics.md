A speculative term, gesturing to a field or practice focused on finding productive ways to use limitations and constraints. Reflective exploration on how working within defined limits/restrictions can drive innovation and creativity.

These might be time or resource limitations, or rule-based constraints (including guidelines, formats, genres). Lipograms, government regulations.

Enhancing flexibility and creativity within limits?

By shaping the "phase space" of potential choices and outcomes, constraints can expand the adjacent possible, leading to breakthroughs and novel forms.

Oulipo used writing constraints as an engine for experimentation. Oulipian constraints interrupt habits to generate surprising "potential literature." Even failed attempts fuel the next experiment; prizing process over end product.

A focusing mechanism? Retuning signal and noise, constraints provide structure and boundaries that can prevent choice paralysis.

Oulipics places agency (and responsibility) on the would-be creator to find purpose and potential within chosen constraints.

Oulipics subverts the notion of fixed forms, using constraints to generate an expansive multiplicity of expressions.

Using constraints to inspire new possibilities, break problems into manageable creative challenges, and interrupt or disrupt normal working patterns to prevent fixation on initial ideas.

As/where generative AI is adopted as a creative partner, Oulipics can help navigate the "paradox of choice" posed by the resulting vast generative potential, and combinatoric explosion. By supply specific constraints as creative prompts, we can better steer outputs, making these systems' expansive possibilities more manageable. Oulipian-inspired human-AI collaborations could point the way forward.
