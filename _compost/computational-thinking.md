A way of looking at problems and systems so that a computer can be used to help solve or understand them.

May involve, e.g., decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking.
  
There are almost always multiple ways of solving a given problem, which may vary stylistically or semantically. A lot of computational thinking is about working through these trade-offs. (ht Tim Cowlishaw)
