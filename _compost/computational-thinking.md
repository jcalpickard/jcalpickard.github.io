A way of looking at problems and systems so that a computer can be used to help solve or understand them.

May involve, e.g., decomposition, pattern recognition, [[abstraction]], and algorithmic thinking.
  
There are almost always multiple ways of solving a given problem, which may vary stylistically or semantically. A lot of computational thinking is about working through these trade-offs. (cf. Tim Cowlishaw)

Computational thinking often involves iterative refinement and feedback, where traditional problem-solving is linear and sequential.

- [?] Is computational thinking a distinct way of thinking, or is it simply applying general problem-solving techniques to computational problems? What sets it apart from other forms of analysis?
- [?] Is computational thinking primarily a tool for solving well-defined problems, or can it also be applied to ill-structured, open-ended challenges?
- [?] Examine the potential biases or limitations inherent to computational thinking. Are there types of problems or contexts where it may be less effective or appropriate?
