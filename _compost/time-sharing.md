The sharing of computing resources among multiple users; a major technological shift in the 1960s-70s that dramatically lowered the cost of providing computing capability, makingit possible for individuals and organisations to use a computer without owning one.

Multiple users access the system concurrently from different terminals. Each user has the illusion of sole control. The system rapidly switches between user tasks, providing quick response times. Resources like CPU time, memory, storage are shared among users in time slices.

> By positioning users as intimate partners of the computer, time-sharing yoked users to a political economy that made users synonymous with their usage, and allowed them (or their advertising sponsors) to be tracked, rented, or billed down to each tick of the clock.

The rise of personal computers shifted the focus from time-sharing to individual computing in the 1980s, though networked computing environments still used time-sharing principles.

Modern cloud computing relies on "virtualisation", a concept closely related to time-sharing.

[[edge-computing|Edge computing]] pushes resources closer to the data source, allowing for more efficient time-sharing across a distributed network. This approach reduces [[latency]], enhancing performance for time-sensitive applications.
