title: "Translocality"
stage: bruck
---

The social, economic and cultural processes, connections and exchanges that occur between and across different localities, involving flows of people, practices, goods and ideas.

Networks and relationships that span distance and/or national borders. Local-local connections. Neither global nor local (transcends the local), focusing on regional and inter-regional linkages and relations.

"Grounded transnationalism"? Translocal homes/homing? Migrant communities maintaining ties and exchanging resources between their origin points and destinations. Religious pilgrimage routes connecting sacred sites across regions. Supply chains and trade networks linking local producers and international markets. Social media enabling everyday communication between dispersed family/friends.

- [⎈] Consider how pilgrimage routes, sacred sites, and religious practices connect people across different localities, creating translocal networks of spiritual significance and cultural exchange.
- [?] How do identities form and evolve across multiple locations? How does translocality contribute to or challenge ideas of place-based identity?
- [?] What role do mobilities and migration play in translocal processes?
- [?] How does technology facilitate or hinder translocal connections?
