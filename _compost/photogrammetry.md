The science and technology of obtaining information about objects and the environment (esp. reliable measurements) through recording, measuring, and interpreting photographic images.

Extracting 3D information from 2D image data by inferring the geometric relationships between multiple overlapping photographs taken from different viewpoints.

Capturing overlapping photographs or images of the subject matter from different angles and positions. Identifying common features across the images. Triangulating the coordinates of those features based on their positions in the different images. Generating a 3D point cloud, mesh, or model representing the object or scene.

Aerial photogrammetry long used for cartography and surveying.

Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques (algorithms?).
