The quality of being an island or insular. Detached or isolated from other groups/systems.

Insular monasticism: monastic communities on islands, characterised by isolation and detachment.

Insular gigantism in small mammals isolated on islands.

Not just about physical islands. Bounding, openness, and closure.

Geographic isolation and detachment. Socio-cultural distinctiveness (and narrow perspectives?). Economic and political protectionism.

But also: focused collaboration within bounded systems. The isolation of insular communities can create environments where new ideas and practices emerge independently of external influences.

- [?] Is insularity always parochical?
- [?] What lessons do insular communities have for those seeking to foster or sustain focused collaboration?
- [⎈] Explore "knowledge islands" and insularity in disciplines, professions, and epistemic communities. How does this relate to issues of interdisciplinarity and knowledge sharing?
- [⎈] Consider the metaphorical extension of insularity to other bounded systems: gated communities, company towns, private members' clubs, closed online groups, etc.
- [⎈] Compare the insular dynamics of remote islands with those of geographically contiguous but culturally distinct regions like mountain valleys or enclaves.
