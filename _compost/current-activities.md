#### Cross-cutting interests

|----------|-------------|
| <big>**[[appropriate-technology|Appropriate technology]]**</big> | Low-tech, decentralised technologies, tailored to specific contexts and user needs |
| <big>**[[communities-of-practice|Communities of practice]]**</big> | The dynamics of practical knowledge acquisition and dissemination within groups |
| <big>**Translocal processes**</big> | The interplay of local practices and global forces, and how this shapes technologies, policy, and the built environment |
| <big>**Knowledge bases and information retrieval**</big> | How people navigate and use information in everyday contexts |
| <big>**Improvisation and contingency**</big> | How people adapt and innovate in real-time, responding to changing conditions through technology design and use |

[^1]: Named for the individual, typically a helmeted pre-teen, who tops out a Catalan _castell_.
[^2]: Named for Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky.
[^3]: Sullivan's coinage; a neologism blending "pantheon" and "pneumatics".
[^4]: "Studies in rawness," broadly speaking.
[^5]: Named for the shadow-casting part of a sundial.
