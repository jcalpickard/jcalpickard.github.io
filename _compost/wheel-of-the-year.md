Annual cycle of seasonal festivals observed by many modern pagan and neopagan traditions. It marks eight major festivals, or "sabbats", spaced 6-7 weeks apart, marking the year's main solar events and agricultural milestones.

A cyclical view of time. Repetition, continuity, interconnectedness.

> 1. Samhain (Oct 31-Nov 1): Marking the beginning of winter. Associated with death and the ancestors.
> 2. Yule (Dec 20-23): Winter solstice, celebrating the rebirth of the Sun and the arrival of longer days.
> 3. Imbolc (Feb 1-2): Fire festival marking the first signs of spring, honouring the Celtic goddess Brigid.
> 4. Ostara (Mar 20-23): Spring equinox, celebrating fertility, new beginnings, and the return of life.
> 5. Beltane (Apr 30-May 1): Fire festival welcoming the warm summer months, associated with fertility.
> 6. Litha (Jun 20-23): Summer solstice, marking the longest day and the Sun's peak strength.
> 7. Lughnasadh (Aug 1-2): First of the annual harvest festivals, giving thanks for crops and abundance.
> 8. Mabon (Sep 20-23): Autumn equinox, a time of balance, reflection, and the second harvest festival.
