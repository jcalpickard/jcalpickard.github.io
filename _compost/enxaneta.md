> "Enxaneta" is a mutual aid-flavoured skill exchange with [Tim Cowlishaw](https://www.timcowlishaw.co.uk/), exploring the intersections of [[ethnography]] and [[computational-thinking]] through Python programming. Collaborating remotely since May 2024, we've been developing "tiny tools" for ethnographic analysis, exploring computational methods in field research, and examining the cultural implications of software development â€” all while reflecting on the process of interdisciplinary knowledge creation.
