Subject of a [special issue](http://doi.org/10.30687/mag/2724-3923/2023/02) of _Magazén_, edited by Paolo Berti, Stefania De Vincentis, and friend-of-the-compost-heap [Gabriele de Seta](http://paranom.asia/about/).

- A space which cannot be “cleared”, completely emptied of danger or conquered by a player, 'permanently inimical and restive terrain' (Roast 2024)
- Political terrain with multiple groupings of inhabitants, or factions, which the players must navigate?
- Any self-contained network of enclosed spaces?[^1]
- A wider infrastructure for continuous, repeated play; a complex spatial field in which repeated explorations can be carried out.
- A specific kind of spatial agency, prompted by the encounter between the player and the environment. A formal spatial practice? (after Roast 2024)

## Nine characteristics of a megadungeon:

>1. It’s big and has many levels; in fact, it may be endless.
>2. It follows its own ecological and physical rules
>3. It is not static; the inhabitants and even the layout may grow or change over time
>4. It is not linear; there are many possible paths and interconnections
>5. There are many ways to move up and down through the levels
>6. Its purpose is mysterious or shrouded in legend
>7. It’s inimical to those exploring it
>8. Deeper or farther levels are more dangerous
>9. It’s a (the?) central feature of the campaign.
