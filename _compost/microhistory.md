title: "Microhistory"

The intensive investigation of a small unit of research (e.g. an event, community, or individual) to trace and reveal broader social/historical phenomena.

Emerged in the 1970s-80s, esp. in Italy, as a reaction against traditional historiography, which emphasised grand narratives and broad generalisations, and social history's reliance on quantitative data.

Key works include Ginzburg's _The Cheese and the Worms_ (1976), about a 16th century Italian miller, and Levi's _Inheriting Power_ (1985), about a peasant uprising.

Privileging "ego documents" (first-hand accounts) to explore historical actor's experiences, and tracking clues through multiple sources to discover hidden connections.

Emphasis on the "exceptional normal"; an event that seems unusual or anomolous, but which becomes a window into important everyday patterns, values or ideas.

Instead of focusing on the "genius" of an individual inventor, a microhistorian might reconstruct the social networks, material practices, and cultural assumptions that shaped a particular development or breakthrough.

Influenced by Geertzian ideas of [[thick-description]].

- [?] What specific limitations in social history and Annales School approaches were the microhistorians reacting against?
- [⎈] Provide concrete examples of how microhistorians use specific practices like tracking clues across sources, reconstructing social networks, and experimenting with narrative form.
- [⎈] Reflect on the critique that microhistory is merely anecdotal or antiquarian. How have microhistorians responded to charges that their work lacks representativeness, or fails to speak to larger historical questions?
