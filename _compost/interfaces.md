Boundary and meeting point. Simultaneously joining and seperating.

Enabling communication, interaction, exchange between two or more distinct systems, entities, or domains, without their merging.

Converting information from one format or "language" to another, to enable mutual comprehension?

Abstraction, encapsulation, and a defined contract or set of rules for interaction ([[protocol]]?). Ways of reducing complexity?

- [?] What, exactly, is an interface? Is it a type of object, process, relation, or something else?
- [?] How do we demarcate the boundaries between systems while still allowing them to connect and/or influence each other?
