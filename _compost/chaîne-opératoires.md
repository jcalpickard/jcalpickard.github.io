French for "operational chain". A methodological concept used in archaeology, anthropology, and material culture to analyse the sequential steps in the production, use, and disposal of artifacts.

After André Leroi-Gourhan and André-Georges Haudricourt. Big deal in lithics.

From the sourcing and acquisition of materials to the abandonment or disposal of the artifact.
