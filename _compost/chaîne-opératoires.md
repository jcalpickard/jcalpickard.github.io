French for "operational chain", or "operational sequence". A methodological concept used in archaeology, anthropology, and material culture to analyse the sequential steps in the production, use, and disposal of artifacts.

After André Leroi-Gourhan, André-Georges Haudricourt, and Marcel Mauss. Big deal in work on lithic (stone tool) technologies.

From the sourcing and acquisition of materials to the abandonment or disposal of the artifact. By breaking down the production process into stages, researchers can identify the tools, techniques, and decision-making processes involved at each step; providing insight into the skill levels, knowledge systems, and traditions of the artifact's creators.

- [?] How might the chaîne opératoire approach be applied to contemporary technologies or consumer products? What might be revealed by tracing their life cycles?
- [?] How could the chaîne opératoire approach be adapted to digital artifacts, such as software or digital media, which have different production and use cycles?
