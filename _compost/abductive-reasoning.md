A form of logical inference that seeks to find the simplest, most likely explanation or hypothesis for an observed phenomenon or set of data, based on the available information.

The aim is produce new hypotheses and theories based on surprising or anomalous empirical findings. Abduction contrasts with induction (finding new cases of existing theories) and deduction (testing existing theories with new observations).

Big argument here is that abductive reasoning is congruent with everyday forms of sensemaking and reasoning, based on incomplete or partial evidence?

- the role of surprise, disconcertment?
- cultivating and working with anomalies?
- an iterative process?
- role of the researcher's community of inquiry[^1]?
- innovative theorising?

[^1]: Need to scrutinise the differences between a "community of inquiry" and a [[communities-of-practice|community of practice]]; if we look past the logocentricism and academic exceptionalism, think there's a case to be made that the former is, in fact, a subcategory of the latter.
