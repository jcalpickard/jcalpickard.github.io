Roughing out. Gerating a preliminary, imperfect version, as a prelude to refining a concept or idea. Shitty first drafts. Vomiting words on a page. Free association, brainstorming. Rapid, spotaneous, iterative cycles of creation, focusing on quality over quantity. Uncontrolled careeening.

Suspending or muting the inner critic. Scribbed notes, mind maps, stream-of-consciousness. Disjointed, incomplete, incoherent outcomes, as a foundation or base for further work. Transition from loose, unstructured exploration to a more defined shape.

Imperfections and uncertainty. Plumbing the subconscious mind, uncovering hidden connections that might have otherwise been overlooked.
