> "[Latent Intimacies](https://github.com/modern-online/latent_intimacies)" is a collaborative exploration of human-machine encounters, using open-source speech synthesis and language models to prototype and investigate new forms of intimacy. Through ethnographically-informed "Études Brut", we embraced technological constraints — local hosting, slow processes, single-user voice input — to reposition AI as a "[[minor-technologies|minor technology]]", revealing unexpected moments of [[latency]], vulnerability, and connection.
