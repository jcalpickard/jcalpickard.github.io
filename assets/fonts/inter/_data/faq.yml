  q: "How do I enable and disable font features?"
  a: |
    In web browsers you can use
    [<q>font-feature-settings</q>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings).
    In Figma you can access features via the
    [Advanced Type panel](https://help.figma.com/article/250-working-with-fonts#opentype).
    In Illustrator, Photoshop and friends, you can access features via the
    [Characters and OpenType panels](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/special-characters.html#opentype_panel_overview).
    Sketch doesn't provide a UI for configuring font features, but there's
    [a workaround using macOS's native font UI](https://sketchtalk.io/discussion/comment/1478/#Comment_1478).

  q: "How reliable are the fonts served from rsms.me/inter?"
  a: |
    <q>https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css</q> and the Inter font
    files are distributed globally over CloudFlare's CDN.
    This is very reliable and fast by automatically serving the fonts
    from a server near your users, minimizing the latency of your web pages.

  q: "Can I change what OpenType features are enabled by default?"
  a: |
    Have a look at [OpenType Feature Freezer](https://twardoch.github.io/fonttools-opentype-feature-freezer/).
    It allows you to customize fonts with certain
    OpenType features "on by default."

- id: faq-contribute
  q: "Can I help with improving Inter?"
  a: |
    Yes you can! Inter is an open-source project, meaning the source
    code—or "source design" if you will—that is used to build the font files
    [are freely available](https://github.com/rsms/inter) to improve upon.
    Font making requires a fair bit of technical work and
    depending on what you'd like to do, some things might be more fun
    depending on your technical skills.
    The ["Contributing" document](https://github.com/rsms/inter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) is a great place to start.
    This document outlines where you can have the biggest impact,
    how things are setup and how to get started.
