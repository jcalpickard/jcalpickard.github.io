<h1>Hello, my name is Justin.</h1>
<p>I'm an independent researcher and editor, working to challenge dominant narratives and uncover hidden meanings.</p>

<p>I'm a strong advocate of creative, cross-disciplinary thinking, appropriate technology, and applied research. My interests include the cultural politics of infrastructure, sociotechnical change, maintenance and repair, social movements, technological appropriation, and experimental and collaborative research methods.</p>
