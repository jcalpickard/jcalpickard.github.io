#### Whether connecting with new people or catching up with old friends, these are some of the ways I prefer to keep in touch.

- üìß The best way to contact me is over [email](mailto:jcalpickard@proton.me). After two decades on Gmail, I've recently switched the bulk of my personal communications to Proton Mail, with encouraging results.

- üåê I have a [profile](https://assemblag.es/@jcalpickard) on [Assemblag.es](https://assemblag.es/), a [community-focused Mastodon fork](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown/wiki) administered by off-duty science and technology studies researchers.[^1] Decentralised by design, the platform's granular privacy settings and self-deleting archive have been instrumental in weaning me off Twitter, presenting fresh opportunities to shitpost into the void.

- üì∑ I share photos of strange objects, sights, and situations with friends and trusted others on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jcalpickard/). Having somehow dazzle-camoflagued Meta's ad-targeting systems, I also treat the platform as a window into the collective unconscious; a way of monitoring the ebb and flow of dropshippers and get-rich-quick schemes.

- ‚å®Ô∏è To streamline my website management and make the most of the simplicty of markdown, I've recently transitioned from Wordpress to a static site hosted on Jekyll using GitHub Pages. With this new setup, I aim to minimising the friction of posting and push more regular updates to my [Log](log.md). Expect a baggy stream-of-consciousness on technology, society, and everything in-between.

- üëî I‚Äôm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinpickard/), though I don‚Äôt pretend to understand it.

- üóÇÔ∏è I'm a paying subscriber and enthusiastic user of research and collaboration platform [Are.na](https://www.are.na/justin-pickard/index), which keeps me attuned to the weird art kids 15 years my junior.[^2] I've been using the since March 2020, and over time, it's become a kind of (searchable) prosthetic memory, and an indispensable part of how I use the internet.

- ‚òï In-person chats have their own magic, and I'm always game for a coffee or a walk. So if you find yourself in York, Leeds, or elsewhere in the north of England, let's make it happen.
