#### Whether connecting with new people or catching up with old friends, these are some of the ways I prefer to keep in touch.

- 📧 The best way to contact me is over [email](mailto:jcalpickard@proton.me). After two decades on Gmail, I've recently switched the bulk of my personal communications to Proton Mail, with encouraging results.

- 🌐 I have a [profile](https://assemblag.es/@jcalpickard) on [Assemblag.es](https://assemblag.es/), a [community-focused Mastodon fork](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown/wiki) administered by off-duty STS researchers. Decentralised by design, with no single company controlling the network, the platform's granular privacy settings and self-deleting archive have been instrumental in weaning me off Twitter, presenting fresh new opportunities to shitpost into the void. (I'm also currently involved in an improbable Python-for-ethnography skill exchange with our Mastodon server admin, Tim.)

- 📷 I share photos of strange objects, sights, and situations with friends and trusted others on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jcalpickard/). Having somehow dazzle-camoflagued Meta's ad-targeting systems, I also treat the platform as a proxy for the collective unconscious, monitoring the ebb and flow of this season's dropshippers and get-rich-quick schemes.

- ⌨️ I've just transferred my website from Wordpress to a static site hosted on Jekyll, using GitHub Pages. The hope is that, by using markdown, I'll be able to short-circuit some of the frictions of posting, pushing more regular updates to my [Log](log.md) (which also has an [RSS feed](https://www.justinpickard.net/feed.xml)).

- 👔 I’m on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinpickard/), though I don’t pretend to understand it.

- 🗂️ I'm an enthusiastic user of research and collaboration platform [Are.na](https://www.are.na/justin-pickard/index), which keeps me attuned to the weird art kids 15 years my junior. After buying a branded hoodie to justify shipping a copy of the site's print annual from the US, the offending garment has ended up in regular circulation, earning impressed and/or bewildered reactions from those in-the-know.

- ☕ A firm believer in in-person conversation, I'm always game for a chat over coffee or a walk — in York, Leeds, or elsewhere in the north of England.
