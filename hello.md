### Hello. Whether connecting with new people or catching up with old friends, this is how I prefer to keep in touch.

• 📧 The best way to contact me is over [email](mailto:jcalpickard@proton.me). I usually respond within 24-48 hours.

• 🌐 I have a [profile](https://assemblag.es/@jcalpickard) on [Assemblag.es](https://assemblag.es/), a [community-focused Mastodon fork](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown/wiki) administered by off-duty STS researchers. I prefer it to other platforms because it's decentralised, with no single company controlling the network. I'm also friends with our server admin, with whom I'm currently involved in an improbable Python-for-ethnography skill exchange.

• 📷 I share photos of strange objects, sights, and situations with friends and trusted others on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jcalpickard/).

• 👨🏻‍💼 I’m on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinpickard/), though I don’t pretend to understand it. For a more accurate impression of my skills, personality, and preoccupations, consider following me on [Are.na](https://www.are.na/justin-pickard/index).

• ☕ I am always keen to explore intersections over coffee or on a walk — in York, Leeds, or elsewhere in the north of England. My schedule is sufficiently flexible that I'm normally able to work around others.
