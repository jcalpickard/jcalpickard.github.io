### Hello. This is how I like to keep in touch.

• 📧 The best way to contact me is over [email](mailto:hello@justinpickard.net).

• 🌐 I have a [profile](https://assemblag.es/@jcalpickard) on [Assemblag.es](https://assemblag.es/), a [community-focused Mastodon fork](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown/wiki) administered by off-duty STS researchers.

• 📷 I share photos with friends, family, and trusted others on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jcalpickard/).

• 👨🏻‍💼 I’m on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinpickard/), though I don’t pretend to understand it.

• ☕ I’m usually game for a coffee or a walk — in York, Leeds, or elsewhere in the north of England.
