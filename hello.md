#### Whether connecting with new people or catching up with old friends, these are some of the ways I prefer to keep in touch.

- üìß The best way to contact me is over [email](mailto:jcalpickard@proton.me). After two decades on Gmail, I've recently switched the bulk of my personal communications to Proton Mail.

- üåê I have a [profile](https://assemblag.es/@jcalpickard) on [Assemblag.es](https://assemblag.es/), a [Mastodon fork](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown/wiki) administered by off-duty science and technology studies researchers.[^1] Decentralised by design, the platform's granular privacy settings and self-deleting archive have been instrumental in weaning me off Twitter, while presenting fresh opportunities to post into the void.

- üì∑ I share photos of strange objects, sights, and situations with friends and trusted others on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jcalpickard/). Having somehow dazzle-camouflaged Meta's ad-targeting systems, I also treat the platform as a window into the collective unconscious; a way of monitoring the ebb and flow of dropshippers and get-rich-quick schemes.

- ‚å®Ô∏è To streamline my website management, I've recently moved from Wordpress to a static site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I'm hoping this new setup will short-circuit some of the friction of posting, helping me push more regular updates.

- üëî I‚Äôm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinpickard/), though I don‚Äôt pretend to understand it.

- üóÇÔ∏è I'm an enthusiastic user of research and collaboration platform [Are.na](https://www.are.na/justin-pickard/index), which keeps me attuned to the weird art kids 15 years my junior.[^2] I've been using the site since March 2020, and over the years, it's become a kind of (searchable) prosthetic memory, and a key part of how I use the internet.

- ‚òï In-person conversation has its own magic, and I'm always game for a coffee or a walk. So if you're passing through York, Leeds, or elsewhere in the north of England, let me know, and we'll line something up.

[^1]: I'm currently participating in an improbable Python-for-ethnography skill exchange with <a href="https://www.timcowlishaw.co.uk/">Tim</a>, our server admin. Wouldn't have got that on Twitter.

[^2]: After buying an Are.na-branded hoodie to justify the cost of shipping the platform's print annual from the US, the <a href="https://store.are.na/products/unisex-hoodie">offending garment</a> has ended up in regular circulation, earning impressed and/or bewildered reactions from those in-the-know.
