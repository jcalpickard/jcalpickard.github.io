#### Hello. Whether connecting with new people or catching up with old friends, this is how I prefer to keep in touch.

• 📧 The best way to contact me is over [email](mailto:jcalpickard@proton.me). I usually respond within 24-48 hours.

• 🌐 I have a [profile](https://assemblag.es/@jcalpickard) on [Assemblag.es](https://assemblag.es/), a [community-focused Mastodon fork](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown/wiki) administered by off-duty STS researchers. I prefer it to other platforms because it's decentralised, with no single company controlling the network. I'm also currently involved in an improbable Python-for-ethnography skill exchange with our server admin, Tim.

• 📷 I share photos of strange objects, sights, and situations with friends and trusted others on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jcalpickard/).

• 👨🏻‍💼 I’m on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinpickard/), though I don’t pretend to understand it. For a more accurate impression of my skills, personality, and preoccupations, consider following me on [Are.na](https://www.are.na/justin-pickard/index).

• ☕ I am always eager to explore intersections over coffee or a walk — in York, Leeds, or elsewhere in the north of England. My schedule is sufficiently flexible that I can normally work around others.
