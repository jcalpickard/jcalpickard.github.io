A collection of evolving notes and half-baked ideas, tended to over time; from scrap and bruck to works in-progress. Inspired by permaculture, a experiment in working and learning in public, outside of project ontologies and gridded organisational time.

A rich personal compost. Umami flavours. Diverse sources and perspectives as fertile ground.

All of the rhizomes. Multiple entry points and pathways, no prescribed journeys. Feedback and contributions welcome.

- *Scrap/bruck:* Gathering raw materials and inspiration
- *Tinkering:* Experimenting with ideas and combining elements
- *Roughing Out:* Shaping the basic form of the sculpture
- *Molding:* Refining the shape and adding details
- *Detailing:* Refining the surface, adding textures, and finalising the piece
