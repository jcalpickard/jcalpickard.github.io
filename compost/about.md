A collection of evolving notes and half-baked ideas, tended to over time; from scrap and bruck to works in-progress. Inspired by permaculture, a experiment in working and learning in public, outside of project ontologies and gridded organisational time.

A rich personal compost. Umami flavours. Diverse sources and perspectives as fertile ground. All of the rhizomes. Multiple entry points and pathways, no prescribed journeys. Feedback and contributions welcome.
